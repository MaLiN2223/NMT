For a good marriage, travel the same way to work
研究：上下班同路有助婚姻美满
Shared dreams and ambitions can help make a successful relationship.
分享梦想与雄心有助于营造成功的婚姻关系。
But it seems the rather less romantic link of a shared commute can also help.
上下班同路也有助于婚姻美满，尽管这听上去不大浪漫。
Married couples are happier if they travel to work in the same direction, says a study. 
一项研究称，上下班同路的夫妇感觉更幸福。
Experts believe it makes couples feel they share wider goals in life.
专家认为这让夫妇们感觉到自己在生活中拥有更多共同目标。
They say the findings suggest newlyweds should consider choosing a home that requires them both to commute in one direction, rather than one located at the midway point between their two work places.
他们说，该研究成果建议新婚夫妇考虑选择让两人能上下班同行的住所，而不是选择位于两人工作地点中间的住所。
'Couples’ marital satisfaction can depend on whether they commute to work in the same or different directions,' said lead researcher Irene Huang, from the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
香港中文大学首席研究员艾琳•黄说，“夫妇们的婚姻满足感可能取决于他们上下班的时候是否同路。”
'Physically moving in a particular goal-relevant direction (e.g. commuting to work) might become associated with more general goal-related concepts.'
“走向同一个与特定目标相关的方向（如一同上下班）可能与共同实现更多总体目标联系起来。
They quote the French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, author of The Little Prince, who said: 'Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but looking in the same direction together.'
他们引用了法国作家，《小王子》的作者安东尼•德•圣-埃克苏佩里的话：“爱不是彼此凝视，而是一起注视着同一个方向。”
Huang and her colleagues found a clear correlation between commuting in the same direction and higher marital satisfaction. 
艾琳•黄和她的同事们发现，上下班同路与较高的婚姻满意度之间有明显的相关性。
They also found that this link existed independent of other factors such as number of years married, number of children, income level and differences in actual time spent commuting.
他们还发现这种相关性独立存在于其他诸如结婚年数、子女个数、收入水平和花在上下班路上的时间等因素之外。
Furthermore, the link did not depend on whether or not couples sometimes left home for work together, meaning it was not due to having the chance to talk together while commuting.
此外，这种相关性也不取决于夫妇们是否有时会一起离家上班，这意味着这种相关性并不是因为夫妇们一起上下班时有更多机会交谈。
The second survey involved 139 married adults in Hong Kong, who were 42 years old on average and had been married for an average of 13 years.
第二项调查在香港进行，有139位平均年龄42岁、平均婚龄13年的已婚成人参与。
It showed a similar correlation to the US results, which also held independent of other relevant factors.
与在美国进行的第一项调查结果相似，其上下班与高婚姻满意度之间的相关性也独立于其他相关因素。
Parsing China's conflicting economic data
拨开中国经济数据迷雾
You can get whiplash from reading the economic news coming out of China these days. 
最近这些天，阅读中国的经济新闻可能会扭伤你的脖子。
One month the skeptics hold up weak industrial output and exclaim, "Crash ahead!" 
某个月，怀疑论者高举虚弱的工业产出数值，惊呼“中国经济即将崩溃！”
The next month, the bulls are back celebrating things like China's 7.7% GDP growth last year.
下个月又轮到乐观主义者大肆庆贺中国GDP增长7.7%这样的向好数据。
The latest sign of China's economic to-and-fro was the recent stock selloff. 
中国经济前后摇动的最新迹象是近期的一波股票抛售潮。
Chinese shares dropped by 15% over the last couple months, doubling the decline of other emerging market shares, in what seemed like a panic signal from traders worried about China's ability to weather upcoming obstacles, including tightening runaway credit and undergoing a massive pivot away from huge infrastructure projects to more sustainable economic growth.
过去几个月，中国股市下跌了15%，跌幅是其他新兴市场的两倍，似乎是股票交易者发出的恐慌信号。他们担心中国可能无法抵御即将到来的挑战，包括收紧失控的信贷，大规模的经济转型，也就是摆脱对庞大的基础设施项目的依赖，走上一条更具可持续性的经济发展之路。
The reports have been back-and-forth for the past six months, but overall they hint at some dark clouds ahead. 
过去六个月的中国经济报告时好时坏，但它们总体上在暗示，乌云就在前方。
Here, then, is a breakdown of the indicators' recent history, where the economy is now, and where it could be headed.
本文试图逐一解析各项经济指标的近期走势，一窥中国经济目前的状况及其未来的发展方向。
Six months ago, China's Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, a key gauge of the economy's strength, was hitting 16-month highs. 
半年前，中国的采购经理人指数 (PMI，这是衡量一国经济实力的重要指标之一)冲上16个月以来的最高点。
The economy looked to be stabilizing after a couple disappointing quarters. 
经历了两个令人失望的季度之后，中国经济似乎正在趋稳。
The PMI news boosted confidence that the country's new leadership in President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang could tackle rampant shadow banking and banks' excess-lending without killing growth. 
来自PMI的好消息提振了市场的信心，促使人们相信习近平主席和李克强总理领衔的中国新一代领导集体有能力应对猖獗的影子银行体系和银行超额放贷问题，同时又不至于扼杀经济增速。
The chief concern back then seemed to be how much the Fed's cutback in bond purchases, or tapering, would hurt China's economy.
当时的主要忧虑似乎是，美联储削减国债购买规模的计划到底会对中国经济造成多大的伤害。
The good spirits were followed by skyrocketing housing prices through the end of last year. 
紧跟在这份好心情之后的是一直延续到去年年末的房价疯涨势头。
Prices rose nearly 30% year over year in December in Beijing and Guangzhou. 
去年12月份，北京和广州的房价同比上涨了近30%。
At the same time, prices in some of the country's smaller third- and fourth-tier cities fell. 
与此同时，一些三四线城市的房价开始下跌。
There's now a break in the market: China's most affluent cities are still booming while smaller ones are starting to falter. 
中国的房地产市场现在出现了一道裂痕：最富裕的城市仍然红红火火，而一些小城市已经开始趔趄。
"If they continue to drop, that will mean banks will have more nonperforming loans, and they will have to further contract lending," says Ran Tao, Acting Director at Brookings-Tsinghua Center in Beijing and professor of economics at Renmin University. 
“房价持续下跌意味着银行将出现更多的不良贷款，它们将不得不进一步收缩贷款规模，”清华-布鲁金斯公共政策研究中心代理主任、中国人民大学经济学教授陶然这样说道。
"Finally, if there's a credit crunch, the housing bubble may burst." 
“如果最终出现信贷紧缩，房地产泡沫可能就会破灭。”
That could start in the smaller cities, and then make its way to the bigger ones. 
这一幕可能会率先从小城市开始，然后逐渐向大城市蔓延。
Rising real estate prices can be healthy for any economy, but in China they're rising so fast that the odds of a crash are growing with them.
房价上涨对任何其它经济体而言都是经济基本面健康的体现，但在中国，飙涨的房价意味着，房地产市场崩溃的几率正在与日俱增。
In January, an unnamed source -- most likely the government -- bailed out a $500-million risky bank investment called Credit Equals Gold No. 1. 
今年1月份，一位未透露身份的接盘人（很有可能是政府）救助了一个规模高达5亿美元、名为“诚至金开1号”的风险投资产品。
While China averted the first default in its trust industry-- an industry that last measured around $1.6 trillion in size and is tailored for rich people searching for high-interest investments -- the news wasn't encouraging. 
虽然中国避免了信托行业的第一起违约事件——根据上一次测算，专为有钱人寻找高息投资机会的中国信托业已经发展到大约1.6万亿美元的规模——但它并不是一个鼓舞人心的消息。
What does it say about other bad bets lurking in the shadows? 
其他潜伏在暗处的不良投资是否也面临着类似的命运？
Was this reminiscent of two Bear Stearns hedge funds blowing up in mid-2007, which intimated problems elsewhere in the financial system?
它是不是让人联想到贝尔斯登旗下那两只于2007年年中崩盘、暗示其他金融机构存在同样问题的对冲基金？
In the beginning of February, China's PMI fell to 50.5, a six-month low (above 50 signals growth). 
二月初，中国的PMI指数下降到了50.5，抵达6个月以来的最低点（大于50说明经济在发展）。
The numbers came just after the news that China posted still-impressive 7.7% GDP growth in 2013. 
就在这些数字出炉前，中国政府刚刚发布消息称，中国2013年GDP增速为7.7%，依然令人印象深刻。
The PMI number was scary because it portended a potential deep slowdown as the country tightens credit and shifts away from a reliance on exports. 
这个PMI数字非常可怕，因为它预示着，随着中国收紧信贷，同时逐渐摆脱对出口的依赖，中国经济有可能严重放缓。
Everyone knows China eventually needs to shift its economy, but that process won't necessarily be smooth. 
谁都知道中国最终需要调整经济发展模式，但这个过程不一定会顺利。
The falling PMI was a reminder of that.
不断下降的PMI指数就是在提醒人们注意这一点。
And about that emerging markets selloff the past couple months: Deutsche Bank took a closer look at the figures and found something revealing. 
最后来谈一谈新兴市场在过去几个月的股票抛售浪潮：仔细审视相关数据之后，德意志银行发现了一个发人深省的问题。
The analysts focused on the difference between the stock performance of China's H share index and A share index -- the difference being that H shares are listed in Hong Kong and widely held by global investors, whereas A shares are listed in the mainland and not open to foreigners. 
分析师重点研究了中国H股指数和A股指数之间的股价表现差异（H股在香港上市，由全球投资者广泛持有；A股在大陆上市，不对外国人开放）。
What they found was that during the two months leading to mid-February, the A share index fell only 6% while the H shares dropped 16%. 
他们发现，在截止2月中旬的两个月，A股指数仅下跌了6%，而H股指数则下跌了16%。
They concluded that the stock market wasn't punishing China, but throwing it out with all the other emerging markets. 
这些分析师总结称，股市并不是在刻意惩罚中国，而是在惩罚所有其他新兴市场时顺带着打压了一下中国。
They wrote, "The only meaningful explanation for the 10% under performance of the H share index is the indiscriminate selling of emerging market equities by global investors."
他们写道，“对H股指数与A股指数跌幅相差10个百分点这一现象唯一有意义的解释是，全球投资者正在不加区分地抛售新兴市场股票。”
The stock market offers some optimism for the Chinese economy facing plenty of other ups and downs.
从许多指标来看，中国经济目前起伏不定，但股市多少让我们对世界第二大经济体的前景抱有一丝乐观情绪。
6 Tips for Expanding Your Social Circles
助你拓展社交圈的6个好办法
Whether you’re interested in advancing your career, or having a new group of friends to go out with, you need to learn—and perhaps master—the skill of making friends. 
无论你是想拓展事业，还是扩张朋友圈，你都需要学习-甚至是掌握-交友技能。
In this article, I would like to share with you 6 tips that will help you expand your social circles.
在这篇文章中，我想要与大家共享6个扩展社交圈的招数。
Connect With Connectors
与社交达人来往
A great way to expand your social circle is to connect to someone through whom you’ll meet many other people. 
有一个拓展社交圈的好办法，那就是与活跃于社交圈的人来往。
Those “connectors” are the types of people who keep friends on Facebook by the thousands, host parties whenever they can, and always seem to be with a large group of people.
那些“社交达人们”正是在脸书上有着成千上万粉丝的人群，他们会随心所欲地举办派对，在别人眼中他们也总是成群结队。
Oftentimes, these are very open people and are easier to connect with than you think. 
通常来说，这些人都非常开放，也比你想象中的还要容易接触。
They might not have the time to invest in a deep friendship with you, but they love to get to know more interesting people to add to their circle.
也许他们没有时间和你发展深刻的友谊，但他们却热衷去结识更有趣的朋友，使其融入自己的圈子。
Meet New People Constantly
不断认识不同的人
A great habit to have is to always be meeting people that you can add to your circles. 
不断认识新人是拓展交际圈的极佳习惯。
In reality, not all the people you meet will become your friends and not all your current friends will be around forever. 
现实中，并非所有你遇见的人都会成为朋友，也并非你现在所有的朋友都会永伴左右。
This is why I always say that if you’re not making new friends, you’re actually making fewer.
这也是我为何总是说如果你没有结识新的朋友，那说明你的朋友在减少。
I recommend that you go to places where it’s easy and appropriate to walk up to anyone and introduce yourself. 
我建议你到一个能够让你轻松、舒适走上前去并向大家介绍自己的地方。
Ideally, you need to go to places where others are open to meeting new people as well. Examples might be trade shows, opening nights, galas, cultural or charitable events, seminars, and talks.
理想情况下，那个地方的人同时也得开怀迎接新朋友。类似的地方就有贸易展览、开幕夜、联欢会、文化或慈善活动、讨论会或茶话会。
Establish Yourself As a Giver of Value
塑造布施者的价值观
When meeting lots of people, you have to “hook”. 
当参加众人聚会时，你得“做钩”。
Nothing hooks better than having a giver attitude. 
没有什么会比布施者的态度更能钩人了。
First, listen really to what they say and imagine if you were them; see the world through their eyes. 
首先，仔细倾听别人，并换位思考；由他们的视野去观摩世界。
Second, be willing to share stories, contacts, or quick advice on what people are talking about.
然后，诚挚地分享你的故事、故人，或及时给对方所说所讲提出建议。
When you meet new people, there are some psychological principles that determine whether or not they’ll want to meet you again. 
与人初见面，依据的是那套心理学原理，那会直接决定对方是否愿意再见你。
This works on an unconscious level. 
这是在潜意识里产生的作用。
One of the most important principles is the giver/takerattitude. 
其中最重要的一条原理就是给予或索取态度。
If they sense that you only care about yourself, connection isn’t going to happen.
若对方感到你只在乎自己，那么你们不会有下文。
You can portray a giver attitude in two ways. 
展现给予态度有两种方式。
The first is about really listening to what they say, imagining the world through their eyes, and giving them your opinion on their stories and situations. 
第一种是认真倾听对方，看对方所看的世界，基于对方的故事和情况来给出你的观点。
The second way is to prove that you’re ready to share similar stories about what they’re talking about, or introduce them to someone who could help them.
第二种是证明你愿意与之分享类似的故事，或者介绍别人伸出援手。
Commit to a Local Community
致力于当地社区活动
One of the fastest ways to boost your social life is to get involved in a community that has the type of people that you want as friends. 
促进社交生活最快速的方式之一就是参加社区活动，加入到那个有你想与之交友的社团里。
This community should be in your local area and should hold social get-togethers once a month, or more.
这个社团得在你们当地区域，并且至少每月举行一次或更多的聚会。
What you do is find one that you like, maybe on meetup.com, and offer your help to the people who run it. 
而你需要做的就是找一家你中意的社团，这可以在meetup.com网站上找，然后向团里的人提供帮助。
They’ll most likely accept, even if they don’t need that much help; they’ll just be glad you’re interested. 
即便他们并不怎么需要那份帮助，但绝大多数都会接受；重点是他们乐意看到你心怀兴趣。
This works great because it makes you meet everyone, and because it establishes you as a giver of value.
这招很有用，因为它能让你遇见不同的人，并能树立你作为给予者的价值观。
Reach Out to People On a Regular Basis
保持定期联系
Staying in touch is vital if you want to keep your social circles alive. 
如果你想要维持社交圈的人脉，那么保持联系是至关重要的一点。
You need to follow up with the people you just met, and catch up with existing friends. 
你需要追上新朋友的步伐，还要关注老友的动态。
The challenge here is that we tend to get distracted and forget about it, and regret later on.
其中的挑战在于我们往往会分心，又因分心而忘记，接着再生悔意。
To solve this problem, you can create a weekly ritual, where you spend only one hour calling, texting, and messaging people. 
要解决这个问题，你可以每周关注一次，也就是每周固定花一小时去打电话、发短信或留言。
Just mark on your calendar a specific day and time, and do it every week. 
这只需你在日历上标出特定的一天，每周执行一次。
A great time to do it is Tuesday or Wednesday, as it gives you the opportunity to make plans with people for the weekend.
最好的日子就是周二或周三，因为能让你和朋友为周末好好计划一翻。
Know the Kind of Friends You Want in Advance
提前了解自己想要结交怎样的朋友
Before you start investing more time on making friends, do a little planning. 
在投资时间去交朋友前，做一个小小的策划。
Try to figure out what kind of people you want to hang out with. 
试着弄清楚你想要与什么样的人出去闲逛。
List out a few qualities, character traits, or interests that you like, and don’t hesitate to be a little more ambitious than usual. 
不妨列出一些对方的品质、性格特征或与你对味的兴趣爱好，不要犹豫，即使在这点上比平时多点野心又怎样。
This is important because it allows your mind to quickly tell if a person you meet could be a great fit for you.
这个方式之所以重要是因为它能让你的大脑迅速分辨出对方是否与你特别对味。
5 Realistic Reasons Why Women Cheat
女性出轨的五大现实理由
As far as stereotypes go, a wandering eye and the urge to jump into bed with multiple partners seems to be built into a man's DNA, but when it comes to cheating, the sexes are created more equally than we think. 
说到男性，大多数人都会觉得他们骨子里是欲望动物：眼神游离不定，还想要拥有多位性伴侣。但是，说到出轨，也许男女比我们想象得更加“平等”。
(Cough, Kristen Stewart, cough.) Renee Lee, a relationship expert with a masters in psychology, dishes out five reasons why women cheat.
（比如克里斯汀•斯图尔特）心理学硕士、两性关系专家蕾妮-李给出了以下5个女性出轨的理由。
Going Through A Transition
正在经历转变
"If it is graduating, turning a certain age, losing a parent or advancing the relationship status, women become introspective," explains Lee. "Even if it is something she wants, such as just getting engaged or graduating, the transition can stir up an array of emotions about where her life is going or where she is in it. The discomfort of change can trigger an impulsive desire to find someone to take her focus off the change and be a diversion for what she is going through."
“如果正面临毕业，到了某个年纪，失去至亲或感情状态更进一步，女性会开始反思自己。”蕾妮解释道，“即使这些是她想要的，比如订婚或者毕业，但这些转变还是会在内心激起波澜，她们不禁会思考应该何去何从，或者她自身的状态。这些变化带来的不快会使人一时冲动去另寻他人来分散自己的注意力，让自己暂时逃避目前的处境。”
2. Not Feeling Adequately Celebrated
2、觉得不够被重视
We've all been here: "May it be getting a promotion, organizing a fundraiser, or making Thanksgiving dinner for a party of 20, men often make the misstep of "not complimenting their partner's achievements," Lee says. 
我们都有过这样的情况：“工作上得到晋升，组织了一次募捐活动，又或者给20人聚会准备感恩节晚餐，男性常忽略的一点是：没有好好赞扬妻子的成就。”蕾妮说，
"Women seek an emotional connection that their partner notices them, is proud of their achievements, and appreciates what they do, so when they aren't getting this at home the residual effects lead to feelings of frustration, dissatisfaction, depression, and restlessness."
“女性总是希望她们的丈夫能给予她们更多关注，为她们的成就而自豪，并感谢她们的付出。所以，当她们在家里得不到这些情感需求时，她们会觉得受挫、不满、沮丧、不安。”
And that's when they could go looking for it elsewhere. 
这时候她们就可能会另寻关心。
"When you are living in the day to day with someone, it is challenging to step outside a situation and notice the things that do matter to someone," adds Lee "As this wears down over time, so as soon as the woman encounters someone who ignites the spark they are lacking at home, they equate it to an emotional connection and seek companionship with someone else."
“当你日复一日地和另一半一起生活后，经常会忽视掉对另一半真正重要的事情。”蕾妮补充道，“随着时间的流逝，一旦女性此时遇到一个可以弥补这些的男性，她们就会视之为感情，进而想和对方进一步发展关系。”
3. Feeling A Relationship Ending
3、觉得感情关系走到尽头
"When a woman feels that uneasy sense that a relationship is on the outs, by either her doing or his, she will often look to fill the void externally to soften the blow," Lee reasons for a woman's infidelity. "If she is the one considering the breakup, she may be using this tactic as a challenge to herself both testing the waters, and then gauge if she can go through with it."
“当一个女性觉得这段感情快要枯萎，不管是自己还是对方所致，她可能会向外寻求慰藉来填补目前的空虚，使自己不至于受到太严重的打击。”蕾妮在分析女性的背叛时，认为“如果她是那个想要分手的人，那她可能会用这种策略来挑战自己同时探探风头，然后寻思是否能这样做。”
4. It's Just Not Fun Anymore
4、生活没有欢乐
...But it's too hard to pull the plug. 
...但却很难停下来。
"When you don't laugh, you don't love. Laughter is one of the key elements in a relationship that often gets overlooked," Lee explains, simply. 
“当你们之间没有了笑声，没有了爱……欢笑是一段关系中很重要的元素，但却经常被忽略。”蕾妮简单地解释道。
"When stresses of day to day life become the dominant factor in a relationship, women feel unhappy. When they come across a coworker, or friend that they have a good time with, it suddenly brings to light what is missing in their own relationship and becomes tempting to act upon."
“当紧张压抑成为每天的主旋律时，女方会觉得不开心。当她们遇到一位可以共度美好时光的同事或朋友时，她们会突然发现这正是目前的感情关系里所没有的，因而会甘愿冒险。”
5. It's Boring In The Bedroom
5、床上生活较枯燥。
Men aren't the only ones who need to spice things up. 
并不是只有男性需要调动情趣。
"Women need to feel desired!" Lee declares. 
“女性也需要得到满足。”蕾妮声称。
If she is not getting any, enough, or nothing to talk about, women start to feel a sexual void. 
如果她的需求得不到满足，女性会开始感到性空虚。
With the popularity of books such as Fifty Shades of Grey, television shows, or listening to friends talk about their fun single trysts, women have that moment when they compare their love life at home to what the rest of the world seems to be experiencing." And that's when she may start to wonder what she's missing.
在女性阅读《五十度灰》等热门书籍、观看电视节目、或听朋友聊单独约会的乐趣时，会将自己的爱情生活和其他人相比较。”蕾妮补充道，“这个时候她会想想自己错过了什么。”
"Though it is easy to pinpoint the flaws in one's sex life, it is often hard to make the changes needed to correct them," adds Lee. "This creates a temptation in women to seek sexual satisfaction elsewhere with someone they don't have the baggage with and can be more uninhibited."
“尽管很容易就可以找出性生活方面的不足之处，但想要改正过来却有些难。”蕾妮补充道，“这会诱使一些女性出去另寻无拘无束的性满足。”
Now you know why women cheat. 
现在你明白了为什么女性会出轨。
But we say, if you're thinking about cheating, just break up with the guy, before you move on to a new one.
但是如果你也正打算出轨，先去和另一半分手吧，然后再去找下一位。
Y Combinator's Paul Graham: Get a co-founder
必读：创业怎么找合伙人
Paul Graham has touched a lot of startups.
保罗•格雷厄姆使很多创业公司深受触动。
Not in the sappy, sentimental way -- though some founders may largely credit him for their success -- but where influence is concerned. 
这种触动不是感情上的触动（尽管有些创始人把自己的成功在很大程度上归功于他），而是与影响力有关。
Because few in the Valley can claim they have interacted with, advised, and funded as many early-stage businesses as Graham has. 
因为硅谷没有几个人敢说他们接触、建议和投资过的初创公司数量比格雷厄姆更多。
Indeed, Y Combinator, the startup incubator he co-founded with wife Jessica Livingston, Trevor Blackwell, and Robert Tappan Morris, has seen 632 startups come and go since 2005, including Dropbox, Airbnb, and online payments platform Stripe.
确实，自2005年以来，他与妻子杰西卡•利文斯顿、特雷弗•布莱克维尔和罗伯特•塔潘•莫里斯共同创建的Y Combinator创业孵化器已经目睹了632家创业公司进进出出，其中包括Dropbox、Airbnb和在线支付平台Stripe。
Last week, Graham announced he was stepping down as Y Combinator President, handing the reins off to partner Sam Altman. 
上周，格雷厄姆宣布辞去Y Combinator总裁职务，把权杖交给了合伙人萨姆•阿尔特曼。
In doing so, Graham will still offer advice part-time to YC startups but cease day-to-day administrative tasks like poring over applications and interviewing applicants. 
格雷厄姆将以兼职身份继续为Y Combinator的创业公司提供建议，但停止了日常管理工作，比如审查申请和会见申请者。
"I spend all the time on that crap," Graham half-joked onstage at this year's LAUNCH Festival in San Francisco.
“我把所有时间都花在了那些破事上，”格雷厄姆在今年的旧金山科技创业盛会LAUNCH Festival上曾经这样半开玩笑地说过这样一句话。
Graham also offered some parting general startup advice, culled from nine years of running YC.
格雷厄姆还根据管理Y Combinator的九年经验，在离别时提供了几条创业的大原则。
Get a co-founder ...
找个联合创始人……
Businesses are more likely to succeed with more than one founder, because each co-founder may bring different strengths. 
拥有多位创始人的企业更有可能成功，因为每位联合创始人可能拥有不同的长处。
Graham used Apple (AAPL) as an easy example: Steve Jobs was a pro with sales while the tech-focused Steve Wozniak couldn't have cared less. 
格雷厄姆把苹果公司（Apple）作为明显的例子：史蒂夫•乔布斯是营销高手，而专注于技术的史蒂夫•沃兹尼亚克完全不用去关心销售的事情。
That's why Graham usually tells YC applicants to get a co-founder. 
这就是格雷厄姆常常告诉Y Combinator申请者去找个联合创始人的原因。
In fact, that's exactly the advice he offered Dropbox CEO Drew Houston when he applied for YC in 2007. 
实际上，Dropbox 公司CEO德鲁•休斯顿2007年申请Y Combinator投资时，格雷厄姆就是向他提供了这条建议。
Houston supposedly did just that, recruiting MIT classmate Arash Ferdowsi in two weeks. 
据推测，休斯顿应该是接受了这个建议，此后不到两周时间便招募了麻省理工学院（MIT）的同班同学阿莱希•菲尔多西。
Now, seven years later, Dropbox has raised $350 million in its latest round with a valuation of $10 billion, far less than the amount Graham recalls Houston would have been willing to sell Dropbox for in the early YC days. 
7年后的今天，Dropbox在最近一轮融资中募得3.5亿美元，公司估值已经达到了100亿美元。格雷厄姆回忆说，这个数字远远高于休斯顿在进入Y Combinator的早期日子里愿意接受的Dropbox卖价。
"The answer was definitely under $10 million -- it might have been under a $1 million or $2 million," he recalled.
格雷厄姆回忆说：“那时他愿意接受的Dropbox卖价肯定低于1,000万美元，甚至有可能低于100万或200万美元。”
But get a co-founder you actually like ...
但要找个你真正喜欢的联合创始人……
Basic? Sure. 
这是基本原则？当然。
But you'd be surprised how many startup founders actually don't gel. 
但你会吃惊地发现，很多创业公司的创始人并不明白这一点。
With YC's three most successful startups -- Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe -- much of Graham and crew's acceptance decision was based on the co-founders themselves and how well they got along. (Of course, a promising idea didn't hurt.) 
就三家最成功的Y Combinator创业公司（Airbnb、Dropbox和Stripe）而言，格雷厄姆和工作人员接受它们申请的决定在很大程度上依据的是联合创始人本身以及他们相处是否融洽（当然，有个好创意没有坏处）。
And if they don't? 
如果他们相处不融洽呢？
Well, that's easy to tell quickly enough, even during a YC interview, which spans a pithy eight to 10 minutes. 
这很容易看出来，Y Combinator面谈时间只有可怜的8到10分钟。
"One guy literally rolled his eyes when his co-founder was talking and pitching us -- a surefire tell," Graham said.
格雷厄姆说：“如果一位联合创始人向我们推介时，另一位却在翻白眼。这就是确凿无疑的信号。”
Focus on a specific subset of users ...
专注于明确具体的用户子集……
Longtime startup investors usually have one startup that had a nifty idea but never quite took off. 
长时间投身创投的人通常都曾投资过一家拥有好创意、但从未真正腾飞的创业公司。
For Graham, it's Etherpad. 
对于格雷厄姆来说，那就是Etherpad。
Released in November 2008 by Appjet, Graham accepted the startup into YCombinator because he "liked the idea so much." 
Appjet在2008年11月发布了这款应用。格雷厄姆接受了这家创业公司的申请，因为他“非常喜欢这个创意”。
Essentially, Etherpad was a Google Docs (GOOG) competitor: a feature-rich, web-based text editor that let multiple users collaborate, write, and edit documents in real-time. (Google acquired the software in late 2009.) 
从本质上来说，Etherpad是Google Docs的竞争对手：这款功能丰富、基于网络的文档编辑器可以让多位用户展开协作，对文档进行实时撰写和编辑（谷歌在2009年底收购了这款软件）。
Problem was, the product lacked focus. 
问题在于，这个产品缺乏焦点。
"They should have launched it as one thing and let people realize, 'Hey this is much more than real-time typing,'" Graham offered.
格雷厄姆说：“他们应该让人们意识到，‘嘿，这个不只是实时输入。’”
Instead of a catch-all approach, Graham said the secret to growth is starting a "small, intense fire" -- first focus on a subset of users and meet their needs. 
格雷厄姆说，增长的秘诀不是广泛撒网，而是“小范围的密集开火”。首先专注于一个用户子集，满足他们的需求。
Again, Graham brought up Apple as an example: The company produced just 200 units of its first personal computer, the Apple I, but sold 175 of them within the first 10 months on sale, largely to computer hobbyists. 
格雷厄姆再次以苹果为例：苹果公司的第一款个人电脑Apple I只生产了200台，但在上市销售的头10个月里售出了175台，大部分卖给了计算机爱好者。
Explained Graham: "You've got to know who those first users are, sit with them, have a party, and focus on them."
格雷厄姆解释说：“你必须知道第一批用户是谁，和他们坐下来，办个聚会，把注意力放到他们身上。”
Why foreign leaders love Silicon Valley
外国领导人为什么都爱参观硅谷
Foreign leaders visiting the United States can fill their itineraries from a long list of fabulous destinations to conduct international diplomacy. 
访问美国的外国元首在开展国际外交的时候原本可以在行程中加入长长一列度假胜地。
Scenic mountains, balmy beaches, and a certain city that never sleeps would seem like top contenders. 
风景优美的名山、温和宜人的海滩和某个不夜城似乎都是最佳的选择。
But instead, presidents and prime ministers from around the world are flocking to Silicon Valley, the land of office parks and suburban sprawl. 
然而，世界各地的总统和首相们却纷纷选择了硅谷这个办公园区林立、郊区扩张无序的地方。
Getting to know top executives from Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), and Apple (AAPL), it turns out, is almost as important as photo-ops and meetings in Washington, D.C.
看来，结识谷歌（Google）、Facebook和苹果（Apple）的高管们与在华盛顿首府合影和会谈几乎具有同等的重要性。
Last week, French President François Hollande became the latest such figure to make a pilgrimage to the world's technology capital. 
上周，法国总统弗朗索瓦•奥朗德成为了最近一个造访全球科技之都的国家领导人。
In the last few years, leaders from Israel, Ireland, New Zealand, Turkey, Russia, Netherlands, Lithuania, and Malaysia have also visited. 
过去的几年中，以色列、爱尔兰、新西兰、土耳其、俄罗斯、荷兰、立陶宛和马来西亚的元首也都曾经来到这里参观。
Their interest reflects the growing muscle of Silicon Valley companies and venture capitalists, with which heads of state are trying to curry favor in hopes of attracting business, investment, and any political cachet that comes from championing innovation.
他们对硅谷的兴趣反映了硅谷公司和风险投资家们日益强大的影响力。各国元首正在向他们示好，希望从这些顶尖的创新思维中找出经商、投资和提高政治声誉的办法。
"They're looking for jobs," said William Miller, a former provost at Stanford University who accompanied a number of foreign delegations in Silicon Valley over the years. "They also have a feeling that a larger company -- whether Intel or Google -- could locate there and become a magnet for others."
多年来陪同过多位外国代表团的斯坦福大学前教务长威廉•米勒说：“他们盯着的是就业机会。他们同时也觉得，无论是英特尔（Intel）还是谷歌，只要大型公司在他们的国家落户，就会吸引其他的大公司。”
During his brief visit, Hollande met with dozens of top Silicon Valley executives. 
奥朗德在短暂的访问期间会见了许多硅谷的顶级高管。
A private lunch included Eric Schmidt, Google's chairman; Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook; and Twitter (TWTR) co-founder Jack Dorsey. 
他邀请了谷歌的董事会主席埃里克•施密特，Facebook首席运营官谢丽尔•桑德伯格和Twitter的共同创始人杰克•多西共进私人午餐。
In addition, Hollande opened a new technology incubator in San Francisco for French startups, which aren't exactly taking the world by storm from home.
此外，奥朗德还在旧金山设立了一个新的科技孵化器来帮助法国的初创公司，后者目前尚未在世界上掀起潮流。
Incubators devoted to just one country, which are often sponsored by foreign governments, have fast become a Silicon Valley fixture. 
通常由国外政府赞助、专门扶持某国企业的孵化器迅速成为了硅谷的一道风景。
Israel, Ireland, Denmark, Germany, and Australia are among those with beachheads that support young companies and help with access to U.S. investors and partners.
以色列、爱尔兰、丹麦、德国和澳大利亚是最早一批赞助新公司、帮助它们与美国投资商和合伙人接触的国家。
The playbook followed by foreign leaders is well-established. 
外国领导人的参观剧本已经形成了固定的路数。
Get off the plane in San Francisco, hold a few events to highlight their enthusiasm for all things tech, then mingle with a few well-known tech executives over a gourmet lunch or at a town hall meeting.
他们从旧金山下飞机，举办几场活动表现出他们对一切科技问题的热衷，然后与几位著名的科技公司高管共进美味午餐，或者在市政厅接见他们。
In 2012, Shimon Peres, Israel's president, made the trip to Facebook's headquarters during a four-day tour of Silicon Valley to promote Israeli startups. 
2012年，以色列总统西蒙•佩雷斯为推动以色列初创公司的发展，展开了四天的硅谷之旅。期间，他访问了Facebook总部。
During an interview on stage with Sandberg, he described himself as a fan of social networking. 
与桑德伯格进行公开会谈时，他把自己形容为社交网络的粉丝。
People can use it, he said, to work around governments and achieve peace on their own -- although peace in the Middle East seems to be just as elusive now as ever.
他表示，不同政府部门的公务员可以利用社交网络协同工作，和平共处——尽管中东从来都没真正存在过什么和平。
Last year, Haiti's prime minister, Laurent Lamothe, made a rare trifecta by visiting the headquarters of Facebook, Google, and Apple in one stateside trip. 
去年，海地总理洛朗•拉莫特到访期间罕见地连续拜访了Facebook、谷歌和苹果的总部。
It was an opportunity to ask wealthy technology companies to help his impoverished country, which is reeling from a devastating earthquake, with jobs and aid. 
当时，他的国家刚刚遭受地震，极其贫困，正是向富有的科技公司请求经济和就业援助的好机会。
The companies donated free servers and some premium online tools. 
这些公司捐赠了免费的服务器和一些额外的网络工具。
But few Haitians have online connections at home, and pledges were small compared to the country's myriad problems.
但是海地几乎没有人能在家里上网，与海地的种种困难相比，这些援助只是杯水车薪。
Like many heads of state that visit Silicon Valley, Hollande was trying to send a message back home that he supports innovation and is working to turn France into a "startup republic." 
就如许多访问硅谷的国家元首一样，奥朗德也试图向国内传达他支持创新、力图将法国建设成“初创公司共和国”的信息。
But many French entrepreneurs accuse Hollande of undermining them with a new law that sets the top tax rate at 75%. 
但许多法国企业家谴责奥朗德，称他颁布新法、将最高税率定为75%是在掏空他们。
Avoiding the tax issue in public comments, Hollande threw out a welcome mat for American investment in French companies. 
奥朗德回避了公众对税务问题的意见，对美国向法国公司的投资表示了欢迎。
Of all the American investment in French companies, one-third comes from California, he pointed out.
他指出，向法国投资的美国公司中，有三分之一来自加利福尼亚。
"In California, you want to change the world, and it's a beautiful mission -- a very ambitious mission, but one we really understand because we have the same vision," he said in a speech at San Francisco's City Hall. 
“来到加利福尼亚，人就想要改变世界，而这是一个美丽的使命，也是一个雄心勃勃的使命。但我们能够理解，因为我们有着同样的愿景，” 奥朗德在旧金山市政大厅的演讲中说。
For centuries, France wanted to change the world, and together we can change the world. 
几个世纪以来，法国一直都想要改变世界，而我们携手并进，足以达成这一目标。
We can change the way we consume, we produce -- the way we deal with health or technology in order to make the world a better place.
我们可以改变我们的消费模式、生产模式，以至于我们应对健康问题和技术问题的手段，从而让世界变得更加美好。
Usually, foreign leaders steer clear of the differences they have with the technology companies they're courting. 
通常，外国领导人会对他们与正在讨好的科技公司之间存在的分歧避而不谈。
No need to inflame tensions, after all, over issues like privacy, human rights, and regulations. 
毕竟，在隐私、人权和法律管制问题上引起紧张情绪是没必要的。
Hollande's government is probing whether technology companies like Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn (LNKD) illegally dodged taxes. 
奥朗德政府正在调查谷歌、Facebook和LinkedIn这类科技公司是否存在非法偷税漏税的问题。
Moreover, France recently punished Google for privacy violations by requiring it to post an embarrassing notice about its misdeeds on its home page for 48 hours.
此外，法国政府最近还惩罚了谷歌侵犯隐私的行为，要求它在网站首页保留48小时的尴尬的道歉声明。
Google did not respond to requests for comment about Hollande's visit or his government or targeting it with investigations. 
谷歌并未就奥朗德的拜访、法国政府及针对谷歌进行的调查问题发表相关评论。
Facebook would only give a vague statement along the lines of, "Let's all work together."
Facebook只是发表了一个模糊的声明，类似于“我们携手并进。”
"We welcomed the opportunity to meet with President Hollande and some members of his government for an open discussion about France and its role in fostering innovation and attracting foreign investment," Facebook said.
Facebook表示：“能够会见奥朗德总统及其政府成员，开诚布公地讨论法国及其在培养创新精神、吸引国外投资问题上扮演的角色，我们对这样的机会表示欢迎。”
The phenomenon of foreign leaders flocking to Silicon Valley isn't entirely new. 
外国领导人纷纷来到硅谷的现象并不新奇。
François Mitterand, another French president, toured Silicon Valley in 1984, during which his wife Danielle, peppered Steve Jobs with uncomfortable questions about worker welfare like overtime pay and vacations rather than gushing about the technology, according to Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography of Jobs. 
沃尔特•艾萨克森2011年在乔布斯的传记中写道，另一位法国总统弗朗索瓦•密特朗1984年年也造访过硅谷。当时，他的妻子丹尼尔并没有探讨科技问题，而是尖刻地就加班工资和假期之类的员工福利问题向史蒂夫•乔布斯发问。
Before Silicon Valley's rise, foreign leaders visited factories in the Rust Belt. 
硅谷崛起前，外国领导人会访问“铁锈地带”的工厂。
Now, it's the same idea, just a different growth industry.
如今，他们怀着同样的目的，只是迅速发展的行业已经不同以往了。
Silicon Valley leaders reciprocate some of the attention they receive. 
硅谷的领袖有时会对所受的关注投桃报李。
When they go abroad, they often find a warm reception. 
他们出国时，往往会受到热烈的欢迎。
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a trip to Japan in 2012. 
Facebook董事长马克•扎克伯格2012年去日本时会见了日本首相安倍晋三。
And last year, both he and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, met with South Korea's President Park Geun-hye.
而去年，他和首席运营官谢丽尔•桑德伯格都会见了韩国总统朴槿惠。
Meetings aren't always courtesy calls. In some cases, some real business-diplomacy is done. 
会见并不总是礼节性的，有时也会达成真正的商业外交。
Last year, in a joint meeting in Paris with Hollande, Google's Schmidt signed an agreement in which the company pledged to pay $80 million to help French media companies build their presence online. 
去年在巴黎与奥朗德的一次联席会议上，谷歌的施密特签署协议，承诺谷歌公司将提供8,000万美元帮助法国媒体公司进行在线展示。
The deal settled a dispute in which French news outlets accused Google of stealing their content by showing snippets of their work in search results.
此前，法国的新闻媒体曾指控谷歌在搜索结果中显示了他们作品的片段，涉嫌窃取他们的内容，而这份协议则达成了彼此之间的和解。
What do Silicon Valley leaders get in return? 
硅谷的领袖又能得到什么回报呢？
Plenty. 
很多。
Friends in high places can only help when it comes time for their governments to draft regulations about intellectual property, immigration, and permitting, for example. 
一旦这些国家的政府就知识产权、移民、许可之类的问题起草法案时，这些身居高位的朋友们就能帮上大忙。
Actual business deals are few and far between, at least in the short term. 
实质性的商业交易至少在短期内不会时常发生。
But the meetings can sometimes get the ball rolling.
但会面有时会让沟通变得更顺畅。
"There's a sense that if the rest of the world is doing better, we'll do better," Miller, the former Stanford provost, said of the CEO mindset. "It's not competition but cooperation. Product innovation doesn't just occur in one place anymore."
斯坦福大学前教务长米勒这样评论首席执行官们的想法：“大家有一种感觉，如果世界上的其他地方正在变得更好，我们也能变得更好。它并不是竞争，而是合作。如今的产品创新已经不再局限于某一个地方了。”
Is there a suicide contagion on Wall Street?
金融行业沦为自杀高发行业？
A few days ago, a Wall Street executive was debating whether he could get away from the office long enough to see his shrink uptown. 
几天前，一位华尔街高管因为能不能请会儿假去上城区看心理医生与别人发生争执。
In the midst of a busy workday, it was looking unlikely. 
在一个繁忙的工作日，这看似不太可能。
Then he stumbled across an article in the New York Post with the disquieting news that a J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) employee had jumped to his death from the bank's offices in Hong Kong, just three weeks after a fellow banker at the firm had committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the bank's London headquarters. 
随后，这位高管碰巧看到了《纽约邮报》（New York Post）上一则让人闹心的消息，内容是摩根大通香港员工跳楼身亡。就在三周前，摩根大通另一名工作人员也从该行伦敦总部楼顶一跃而下。
"JPMorgan suicide is 3rd mysterious death in weeks," read the Post headline.
《纽约邮报》这篇文章的题目是《摩根大通几周内连续爆出三起员工神秘自杀身亡事件》。
The executive went to his appointment. 
这位高管还是去看了他的心理医生奥尔登•卡斯。
"He said, 'That's what drove me into your office today, I want to make sure that I'm all right,'" says Alden Cass, the psychologist who treats the executive, as well as a bunch of clients who are portfolio managers, investment bankers, and traders of all types.
后者回忆道：“他说，‘这件事促使我今天到你的办公室来，我想确认自己没有问题。’”除了金融公司高管，卡斯还有很多客户，其中包括投资经理人、投行人士以及各式各样的交易员。
The rash of suicides has sent a shudder through Wall Street and beyond. 
自杀事件集中出现，受到震撼的不仅是华尔街。
The third death referenced by the Post—that of a J.P. Morgan executive director who died inside his Connecticut home in January—did not appear to be intentional. (A report is still pending.) 
《纽约邮报》提到的第三起死亡事件看起来不像是自杀——摩根大通一位执行董事今年1月份死在康涅狄格州的家里（死因报告尚未公布）。
Yet the J.P. Morgan incidents are only the most recent in a string of at least a half-dozen suicides in the financial world since late August. 
其实，去年8月底以来，金融行业至少已有六人自杀，摩根大通的员工死亡事件只是出现的最晚而已。
Those include executives at Zurich Insurance Group (ZURVY), Deutsche Bank (DB), and Russell Investments, among other firms.
发生同样悲剧的还有苏黎世保险集团、德意志银行和Russell Investments等公司。
Banker suicides aren't a new phenomenon. 
银行业人员自杀不是什么新鲜事。
Clusters of them in quick succession occurred during the Great Depression and during the recent Great Recession. 
上世纪30年代大萧条以及最近一次的经济大衰退期间，银行业人员都曾接二连三地自杀。
Indeed, research has shown that suicides can be contagious, so to speak. 
实际上可以这么说，相关研究已经证明自杀会传染。
That is particularly true when graphic and sensational reports of the fatalities lead to copycats, according to the American Association of Suicidology. 
美国自杀学协会指出，情况确实如此，有关自杀的图片和煽情报道会引起他人的效仿。
So the recent untimely deaths have sparked concerns that there could be more on the way. 
因此，最近这些不合时宜的死亡事件已经开始让人们担心可能还会有人自杀。
J.P. Morgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti says the company has sent notices reminding employees that 24/7 mental health-related support resources are available at the bank, and that its hearts go out to the families of the deceased.
摩根大通发言人乔•埃万杰利斯蒂表示，公司已经通知员工，摩根大通可以随时为他们提供精神健康方面的帮助，而且公司对已故员工的家属深表同情。
But with each new wave of suicides come questions about whether the deaths signify a disturbing trend: Is finance a potentially deadly occupation? 
不过，自杀事件的集中爆发每每都会带来这样的问题——这些死亡事件是否代表了一种让人不安的情况，那就是，从事金融业可能有生命危险？
That is, do bankers kill themselves more often than other people?
或者说，银行业人员自杀的几率比其他行业高吗？
To find out, Fortune asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to pull the latest suicide statistics from its National Occupational Mortality Surveillance database. 
为了找到答案，本刊邀请美国疾病控制与预防中心从它的国家职业死亡率监测数据库中调出了最新的自杀数据。
During 1999, 2003, 2004, and 2007—the most recent years during which research was funded and for which data is available—there were 329 suicides among financial specialists, more than in any other occupation tracked by the CDC except for the broad grouping of "engineers and scientists," a cohort that lost 502 to suicide.
近些年来，相关研究获得资金支持并且有数据可循的年份包括1999、2003、2004和2007年。在这四个年份中，有329名金融业从业者自杀，超过了该中心跟踪的其他任何行业。只有“工程师和科学家”这个大类出现了502名自杀者，多于金融业。
Finance, however, is a vast profession, and while the total number of finance professionals who commit suicide may be larger than for some other professions, they are actually less likely to do so than, say, lawyers or firefighters.
但金融业的覆盖范围很广，虽然自杀的金融从业人员总数可能超过其他一些行业，但金融业人士自杀的可能性实际上要低于某些职业，比如说律师和消防员。
Take J.P. Morgan as an example: At a bank with more than 260,000 employees around the globe, a pair of suicides may seem shocking and random but the figure is, in fact, well within the range of statistical probability. 
以摩根大通为例，这家银行全球员工总数超过26万人，出现两起自杀事件可能显得很吓人而且毫无规律，但实际上，这个数字完全符合统计概率。
Two might even be a low number. 
有两名员工自杀甚至可能属于较低水平。
"You would expect that when people work these long hours," says Alexandra Michel, a former Goldman Sachs (GS) investment banker turned management professor at the University of Pennsylvania who for 12 years has been tracking the performance and health of a group of Wall Street recruits at two banks (she can't say which) in an ongoing study. "You would think that it would happen much more often."
宾夕法尼亚大学管理学教授亚历山德拉•米歇尔曾在高盛投行部门任职。她目前正在进行一项研究，因此12年来一直在跟踪两家华尔街银行（她不能透露这两家银行的名称）一批新雇员的表现和健康情况。米歇尔说：“他们的工作时间很长，外界会对他们有这样的看法，人们会认为他们自杀的频率要高得多。”
A close examination of the CDC data does reveal a worrisome connection between certain types of financial jobs and an elevated risk of suicide. 
仔细查看疾病控制与预防中心的数据后，我们并没有发现那个让人担心的现象，即某种金融工作的自杀风险较高。
The CDC organizes its mortality numbers by census categories, which can be pretty broad. 
该中心按人口普查的方式计算死亡率，这种方法可能相当笼统。
The Wall Street-oriented classification is "sales representatives for financial and business services"—a category that includes a variety of banking positions, ranging from investment advisers to brokers to traders to investment bankers. 
在该中心的统计类别中，和华尔街属于同一性质的是“金融和商业服务销售代表”——它包含了各种各样的银行业工作——从投资顾问、经纪人到交易员，再到投行人员。
People in that group are 39% more likely to kill themselves than the workforce as a whole. (Members of some other white-collar professions are at even greater risk: Lawyers are 54% more likely than average to commit suicide, and physicians are 97% more likely.)
这个类别的自杀可能性比整个就业者群体高39%（某些白领职业的自杀风险甚至更高：律师的自杀几率比平均值高54%，医生则高97%。）
Within finance, observers say that investment bankers are often under the most acute mental stress. 
观察人士认为，在金融行业中，精神压力最大的往往是投行人员。
"Out of all the sections of finance, no position do I know of that's more extreme in terms of the emotional endurance one has to have than investment banking," says Cass, the psychologist who is also the co-author of Bullish Thinking: The Advisor's Guide to Surviving and Thriving on Wall Street.
卡斯指出：“据我所知，在所有金融领域中，对情感耐受力的要求最为极端的非投资银行莫属。”卡斯还和人共同撰写了一本书，名叫《牛市思维：华尔街生存和成功指南》
It's a syndrome Michel has also observed while shadowing investment bankers over the years. 
米歇尔还观察到，随着时间推移，投行人员会出现一种综合症。
After her subjects had worked at a bank for four years on average, she began observing signs of sleeplessness, anxiety, and depression: 
她发现，观察对象在华尔街银行平均工作四年后开始出现失眠、焦虑和抑郁等情况。
"I could see how people came in chatting happily on the phone with friends, how that became less and less," she says. "People became completely absorbed in the office, in work. Some are feeling trapped."
米歇尔说：“我能看到他们刚开始还能心情愉悦地和朋友打电话，然后这种现象就会越来越少见。他们完全陷在了办公室里，陷在了工作里。有些人觉得自己被困住了。”
J.P. Morgan says the two employees who committed suicide weren't investment bankers, per se. 
摩根大通表示，这两名自杀的员工本质上不属于投行部门。
According to their LinkedIn (LNKD) profiles, Gabriel Magee was a vice president overseeing technology for fixed-income securities in the London office, and Dennis Li was an associate in the billing department supporting the investment bank.
他们在领英（LinkedIn）上的个人简介显示，加布里埃尔•马吉是摩根大通伦敦方面固定收益证券部门负责技术事务的副总裁，李俊杰（音译）则是为投行业务提供支持的票据部门副经理。
But the high-stakes world of Wall Street has become a more stressful work environment across the board. 
但就整个华尔街来说，这个高风险领域的工作压力比以前更大。
The 2008 economic crisis and subsequent recession have exacerbated the problem, says Cass, especially now that the new reality of smaller bonus checks, regular layoffs, and heightened regulation has sunk in. 
卡斯说，2008年的经济危机以及随后的衰退让问题变得更加严重，特别是出现了一些新的因素之后，比如奖金缩水，经常裁员以及监管更加严格。
While those factors have impacted many professions, Cass says, "In investment banking, it becomes a weed-out process—who can take it and who can't?"
虽然这些因素给很多职业都带来了冲击，但卡斯指出：“投行工作已经成了一个筛选过程，也就是说，要看谁能坚持住，谁坚持不了。”
Cass has noticed the scrutiny weighing on his clients. 
卡斯已经注意到严密监督给自己的客户带来的压力。
The anxiety has trickled down from bosses and pervaded the culture, he says, with bankers kept in a "fear position," worrying constantly about keeping their jobs—or worse, facing criminal charges.
他说，从最高层传递下来的焦虑情绪充斥在公司文化当中，银行业员工都处于“草木皆兵的状态”，总是担心自己能否保住饭碗，更有甚者，总是担心自己遭到刑事指控。
A CDC analysis of suicides by occupation for 2008 and beyond won't be ready until 2015. 
疾病控制与预防中心要到2015年才能公布2008年起各类职业自杀数据的分析结果。
But the government agency recently reported an alarming increase in suicides between 1999 and 2010 among Americans old enough to be at the peak of their careers or well-established in the C-suite. 
但这个中心最近发布报告称，1999-2010年间，在年龄足以达到职业生涯顶峰或者稳居高级管理职位的美国人当中，自杀事件的增长幅度令人担心。
Suicides among 35- to 64-year-olds rose 28%, with even larger increases among white people (40%) and those over 50 (more than 48%).
这个群体的年龄介于35-64岁，在上述时间段内他们的自杀人数增加了28%，白人（上升了40%）和50岁以上（增幅超过48%）人群的增速更快。
While it's not fair, warns Cass, to point blame at any one firm or the industry itself, he sees the increased pressure to avoid mistakes as taking its toll on bankers. 
卡斯警告，虽然指责具体的某一家公司或金融行业本身并不公平。但他认为，避免失误的压力日益增长，正在对银行业人员产生不利影响。
"Obviously it's good for the collective health of our financial security in the long run," he says. 
他说：“显然，它有益于我们在金融安全方面的长期整体健康。”
For the near term, his clients are keeping their appointments.
而在短期内，卡斯的客户们还会继续来见他。
The secrets to winning an Academy Award
“小金人”背后的秘密
If the Oscars seem boring and predictable to you this year, then you're in good company. 
如果你觉得今年的奥斯卡很无聊，结果在你的预料之中，那么你和很多人想到一块去了。
Sociologists have considered the Academy Awards predictable for a long time.
社会学家早就认为奥斯卡奖是可以预测的。
A few weeks ago, I spoke with Gabriel Rossman, a UCLA sociologist with some of the most interesting research on the intersection of economics and pop culture. 
几周前，我和加布里尔•罗斯曼（洛杉矶加州大学的一位社会学家）聊起经济和流行文化结合方面最有意思的一些研究。
Rossman has two fascinating papers about the Oscars. 
罗斯曼手头有两篇关于奥斯卡的论文，很有意思。
The first addressed the tantalizing question: What qualities of a movie best predict Oscars nominations?
第一篇解答了一直困扰人们的问题：一部影片具备什么样的条件才能获得奥斯卡提名？
Unsurprisingly, the biggest correlation was being in a very serious movie. 
令人并不感到意外的是，最大的因素是和影片的严肃性相关。
Considering 172,000 performances listed on IMDB in 20,000 movies, Rossman and co-author Nicole Esparza found that dramas were were nine times more likely to get nominations.
通过研究IMDB上20000部影片的172000次点映，罗斯曼和论文的另一个作者妮可•埃斯帕扎发现，剧情片比其他类型影片获提名的可能性高出九倍。
The second and third best predictors both had to do with the size of the competition. 
第二大和第三大因素都和竞争的规模相关。
When there are fewer films released around awards season, the odds that any one movie gets a nomination increases. 
当颁奖季上映的影片很少时，任何一部影片获得提名的机会就增加了。
This simple principle applies, rather unfortunately, to actresses, as well. 
很不幸的是，这个简单的规则同样适用于女演员获奖提名。
It's an industry truism, borne out in the evidence, that women have fewer meaty roles in the types of movies likely to be nominated for an Oscar. 
有证据表明，在可能被提名奥斯卡奖的影片里，内容充实的女性角色很少，这是行规。
That means any one dramatic end-of-year performance by a woman has a higher chance of earning a nomination.
这意味着，一个女演员年末任何一个打动人心的表演都很可能获得提名。
Perhaps the most substantive finding in the paper is that people with high IMDB movie rankings in past movie credits were more likely to work with other stars, doubling their chances at getting a nomination. 
也许论文最重大的发现是，在过去的影片评分中，影片获得IMDB高评分的人更容易和其他明星相处，使得他们得到提名的机会也翻了一番。
“Actors are going to look good when they work with talented people," Rossman told the Daily Bruin. "This is an interesting thing since you tend to get talented people working with other talented people, meaning that people will end up looking even better than when just working alone.”
罗斯曼告诉《洛杉矶加州大学校报》“演员和有才华的人合作将表现良好”，“这是件很有意思的事，因为你倾向于使有才华的人聚在一起工作，这意味着他们最后会比一个人工作时表现要好。”
Maybe this seems completely obvious to you: Better actors get better parts and then get to work with better directors (hello, Leonardo DiCaprio). 
可能你很明白：好的演员得到好的角色，能够和好的导演一起共事。
But it's also a classic example of what sociologists call cumulative advantage or the "Matthew Effect," named after the passage in Matthew where Jesus says "For to everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich." 
但是这也是一个典型的被社会学家称为积累优势或“马太效应”的例子。“马太效应”这个名字来源于《马太福音》，在这部著作中耶稣说道“凡有的，还要给他更多使他变得富有。”
This isn't as simple as the rich getting richer. 
这并不是简单的“富有的变得更加富有”。
It's the idea that slightly more talented people get access to higher-quality support for their talents, which greatly multiplies the benefits of their innate advantage (e.g.: smarter students going to colleges with better professors and better career services connections).
这说的是稍微更具才华的人会获得更优质的支持从而大幅增加他们固有的优势（例如，更聪明的学生上大学接触更好的老师获得更好的职业发展机会）。
The fact that movies with stars get more Oscar attention might be an indication that Hollywood's stars are simply better than its non-stars. 
有明星的影片会得到奥斯卡更多的关注，这可能表明好莱坞的明星比不是明星的演员更出色。
But probably not. 
但恐怕不是这样。
It's much more likely a sign that (just as you might have suspected) we're bad picking out discrete instances of talent in star-studded projects. 
（正如你所怀疑的那样）这可能更多地表明在众星云集的电影行业中，我们不善于挑选出个别的有才华的演员。
This would imply we—or, at least, the Academy—is just as bad at recognizing Oscar-worthy talentin movies without any past Oscar nominees. 
这暗示，我们——或至少是奥斯卡——一样地不善于认可没有任何曾提名过奥斯卡的演员但颇具才气、值得奥斯卡奖的影片。
In both cases, the context overwhelms our ability to recognize individual achievement.
在这两种情况下，大环境支配我们认可个人成就的能力。
Rossman's second Oscar paper is about audiences and prizes. Some producers really want to win Oscars. 
罗斯曼第二篇关于奥斯卡的论文是关于观众和奖项的。
These producers would also, presumably, like to make money. 
一些制作人真的很想要获得奥斯卡奖。这些制作人可能想赚钱。
The problem is that audiences don't like most movies that are "Academy Award movies"—here defined as late-year releases about serious subjects (like AIDS, slavery, or technological dystopia)—so the business of making an Oscar-y movie is high-risk with dubiously high reward.
问题是，大部分的“奥斯卡奖影片”——这里指的是上映的晚，话题沉重（像艾滋病、奴隶制、技术敌托邦）——观众都不喜欢。因此，制作一个为奥斯卡量身定制的影片这门生意是风险很高的，高回报则不一定。
Rossman explains it well:
这一点罗斯曼解释得很好：
It turns out that audiences dislike movies that are *trying* to get Oscar nominations but really like movies that actually *get* Oscar nominations. 
事实上，观众不喜欢“试图”得到奥斯卡提名的影片，但确实喜欢真正"得到"奥斯卡提名的影片。
By inference, if there were no Oscars to drive box office towards them, there would be far fewer movies about historical protagonists overcoming oppression. 
根据推理，如果没有奥斯卡推动票房，那么关于战胜压迫的历史人物的影片将会少之又少。
Indeed, it looks like Hollywood basically nails it since they make exactly the right number of Oscar-targeted movies that the two effects balance out on average.
的确，好像好莱坞基本上敲定了奥斯卡，因为他们生产的影片的数量正好是奥斯卡需要的影片数量，他们基本上持平了。
To the victors go the spoils, kind of. 
胜利者总有点备受宠爱。
Best Picture winners can expect a 22 percentraise in box office after a nomination and another 15 percent bump if they win, according to IBISWorld. 
据市场研究公司IBISWorld讲，最佳摄影奖获得者在提名之后可以获得票房的22%，在获奖之后可以再获得15%。
But the financial calculations probably miss the best reasons to try to make an Oscar movie: To win accolades within the industry, to win access to stars who can make you more money down the line and, just maybe, to bask in the honor of making a truly great film.
但是光计算金钱可能遗漏掉试图制造一部奥斯卡影片的最佳原因：在本行业内赢得荣誉，获得将来能为你赚更多钱的明星，或仅仅是为了获得制作一部真正伟大影片的荣誉。
Screens put years on you: 'Computer face' is giving women jowls and lines
职业女性应警惕“电脑脸”
A growing number of women are developing something called 'computer face', a leading cosmetic surgeon said.
一位权威整容外科医生指出，越来越多的女性正在患上一种被称作“电脑脸”的症状。
Dr Michael Prager said professionals who worked long hours in front of a screen were ending up with saggy jowls, 'turkey neck' and deep-set wrinkles on their forehead and around their eyes.
迈克尔•普拉杰医生说，职业女性长时间在电脑前工作，将会导致她们面颊下垂、出现“火鸡脖”、前额和眼睛周围皱纹深陷。
The Botox specialist said that, of all his clientele, office workers were most likely to show premature signs of ageing.
这位肉毒杆菌整容专家表示，在他所有的客户中，办公室女性最易显现出提前衰老的迹象。
'If you are one of the unfortunate people who frown or squint while they are concentrating at the screen then, over time, you will inevitably end up with frown lines,' Dr Prager, 42, said.
42岁的普拉杰医生说：“如果你在电脑前专心工作时常常蹙眉或眯眼斜视的话，那么很不幸，长此以往，你的面部将不可避免地出现皱纹。”
'What is perhaps more surprising is the number of women with saggy jowls because they are sitting in one position for so long.
“可能更令人震惊的是，竟然有这么多的女性有面颊下垂的症状，因为她们长时间都保持同一坐姿。”
'If you spend most of the time looking down then the neck muscles shorten and go saggy, eventually giving you a second neck.
“如果大多数时间你都埋头俯视状态，颈部肌肉就会萎缩并且变得松弛，最终导致双下巴。
'We are seeing a lot of women who work in executive jobs in offices who have this problem.' Dr Prager, who has a practice near Harley Street in London, said he encourages his clients to put a mirror next to their computer so they can see if they are frowning at the screen.
“我们看到许多在办公室里担任管理职务的女性都有这个问题。”在伦敦哈利街附近执业的普拉杰医生建议客户在自己的电脑旁边放置一面镜子，以便能看到自己是否在皱着眉头看电脑。
'When people are stressed or thinking hard about something then they will often put on a "grumpy face" without even knowing what they are doing. When my clients put a mirror next to their desk they are often shocked by the angry, frowning face which stares back at them.'
“当人们压力大，或在努力思考某件事情的时候，常常会摆出一副‘暴躁的面孔’，而自己却意识不到。当我的客户们在自己桌旁摆了镜子以后，她们常常会对镜中瞪着自己的那张愤怒、眉头紧锁的脸感到震惊。”
He warned that a generation of younger men and women who had grown up with information technology were developing 'computer face' at a much earlier age.
他告诫说，伴随着信息技术成长起来的年轻一代男女正在出现“电脑脸”，而且呈年轻化趋势。
He said: 'The women I am seeing at the moment have only been using computers at work for the last decade or so. But women in their 20s have grown up with them and use them for every single task.
他说：“目前我所治疗的只是在电脑前工作了十年左右的女性。但是那些20多岁的女孩则是在电脑的陪伴下成长的，她们的每一项工作都离不开电脑。”
'It will be completely different for them and I think the problem is going to become much, much worse. In another ten years, they could be looking quite awful.'
“对她们来说，情况就会完全不同，而且我认为这个问题将变得更加糟糕。再过十年，她们看起来可能会相当恐怖。”
Dr Prager said there were several simple steps which could stave off computer face such as regular screen breaks and stretching the neck muscles. 
普拉杰医生说，有几种简单的方法可以延缓“电脑脸”的到来，诸如定期离开电脑屏幕休息一下，伸展颈部肌肉。
And, of course, there was always Botox.
当然，注射肉毒杆菌也会有作用。
He said that, after a couple of sessions of Botox, the habit of 'grumpy face' could be broken.
他说，经过几个疗程的肉毒杆菌注射，爱摆“暴躁的面孔”这样的坏习惯可能得到改正。

What singles really what
嫁还是不嫁 这是个问题
A recent online commercial tells the following story: upon graduating, getting a job and being promoted, the female protagonist’s grandmother, whose health is in decline, keeps asking her the same question, “When are you getting married?”, until the woman finally rushes home in a wedding dress to bring the elderly lady in her dying days the ultimate comfort.
最近一则网络广告的情节如下：每当女主角经历大学毕业、求职成功、工作晋升时，年迈多病的外婆嘴边总是挂着同一个问题：“结婚了吧？”；直到广告结尾，女主角身披婚纱冲回家中，终于在外婆临终满足了她最大的心愿。
Marriage puts a lot of pressure on single women, as if they are destined to get married in order to fulfill others’, rather than their own, expectations. 
婚姻令单身女性们不堪重负，仿佛她们结婚并不是为了自己，而是为了满足他人的期望。
But what’s pushing single women into matrimony is a social stereotype and form of self-identification that creates a dilemma for modern women in today’s social contexts, experts say.
然而专家表示，是约定俗成的社会观念以及通过婚姻实现自我认同迫使单身女性早日嫁人，这也造成了当今社会中现代女性的窘境。
In the book Seeking Happily Ever After: Navigating the Ups and Downs of Being Single Without Losing Your Mind (and Finding Lasting Love Along the Way), US author Michelle Cove tries to reveal what women really want out of a relationship. 
在《寻找幸福——不失本心地走过单身的起起落落，并沿路找寻天长地久》一书中，美国作家米歇尔•卡夫试图揭露出女人在感情中真正想要的东西。
As reported in Marie Claire, a women’s magazine in the US, Cove identifies some of the categories of single women based on intensive interviews.
在美国女性时尚杂志《嘉人》的一篇报道中，卡夫在对一些单身女性进行深入采访后，将她们分成了如下几类：

Vaccination efforts have almost ended the risk of polio infection in most countries.
疫苗工作使得大多数国家免于脊髓灰质炎感染的风险，
But the World Health Organization says the virus is still a problem in a major Pakistani city.
但世卫组织称这种病毒在巴基斯坦一个大城市仍是一大问题。
The World Health Organization has declared the Pakistani city of Peshawar, the world's "largest reservoir" of endemic poliovirus.
世卫组织宣布巴基斯坦城市白沙瓦是全世界最大的脊髓灰质炎病毒来源地，
And WHO officials fear Pakistanis could face travel restrictions unless steps are taken immediately to stop the disease from spreading.Christopher Cruise has more.
世卫官员担心除非立即采取措施阻止这种疾病的蔓延，否则巴基斯坦人将面临旅行限制。克里斯多夫·克鲁斯报道。
Researchers studied all the cases of poliomyelitis in Pakistan last year.
研究者研究了去年巴基斯坦的全部脊髓灰质炎病例，
The researchers found that almost every case could be linked genetically to the poliovirus often reported in Peshawar.
发现几乎每个病例都与白沙瓦经常报道的脊髓灰质炎病毒存在基因上的关联。
They added that all test samples collected from different parts of the city have shown the presence of the highly infectious virus.
他们称从该市各地区收集的实验样本都表明高度感染病毒的存在。
Polio mainly affects children under five years of age. The virus is passed through food or water.
脊髓灰质炎主要影响五岁以下儿童。
The virus reproduces in the body, and later invades the nervous system.
这种病毒通过食物和水传播，能在体内繁殖并入侵神经系统。
The disease can sometimes lead to paralysis, with loss of muscle control in part of the body.
这种疾病有时导致瘫痪，身体部分地方的肌肉失去控制。
The WHO study found that 90 percent of Pakistan's polio cases could be linked to the virus in Peshawar.
世界组织研究发现，巴基斯坦90%的脊髓灰质炎病例都与白沙瓦的病毒有关联。
In addition, 12 of the 13 polio cases in Afghanistan were also linked to the city.
另外，阿富汗每13个病例就有12个与该市有关联。
Elias Durry serves as the WHO's emergency coordinator for polio in Pakistan.
伊莱亚斯·迪里是世卫组织驻巴基斯坦的脊髓灰质炎紧急协调员，
He says local officials need to take urgent action to strengthen vaccination campaigns.
他说当地官员需要采取紧急行动加强疫苗接种活动，
He says the situation in Peshawar not only threatens the gains Pakistan has made against polio,
他说白沙瓦的情况不仅会威胁巴基斯坦在对抗脊髓灰质炎上的进步，
but could also harm international efforts to stop the disease.
还会影响国际上对抗该疾病的努力。
"Unless the polio eradication program in Pakistan is able to curtail the transmission in Peshawar,
“除非巴基斯坦的脊髓灰质炎根除计划能遏制住在白沙瓦的传播，
the expansion of, of the viruses to other places will not stop,
这种病毒还会向其他地区传播。
so it is critical that Peshawar, the way it is behaving now, really be able to find ways of interrupting these transmissions that have been consistent throughout the years."
所以，关键的是白沙瓦的现行措施能够确实阻断多年来的传播。”
He also noted an increase in deadly attacks on vaccination campaign workers in and around Peshawar, and in other areas.
他还指出白沙瓦内外和其他地区都出现针对疫苗接种人员的致命袭击。
Taliban militants often attack polio workers in Pakistan.
塔利班武装分子经常袭击巴基斯坦的脊髓灰质炎接种人员，
The militants accuse them of being American spies or part of a plot to keep Muslims from having babies.
他们指责这些人员是美国的间谍，或是参与阻止穆斯林怀孕的阴谋。
Most of the attacks have taken place in Peshawar because the city is close to the country's tribal districts.
大多数袭击发生在白沙瓦，因为该市临近该国的部落地区。
Extremist groups have bases in those areas.
极端组织的总部都在这里。
Elias Durry did not reject the possibility of other countries ordering travel and visa restrictions on Pakistan if there is no quick improvement in the situation.
Elias Durry并不否认，如果不立即改善这一现状，那么其他国家可能对巴基斯坦实施旅行和签证限制。
In neighboring India, no polio cases have been reported for the past three years.

Well, that's relative.
嗯,这是相对的。
It was close by space standards, it wasn't in terms of miles.
它是空间标准的擦身而过,而不是英里。
But since there is a one in 10,000 chance of this same asteroid coming back near us, on March 4, 2046, Chad Myers is going to help us get to know it.

And you have something going for it.
而你得做些什么。
Now, this is not one of the closer ones probably will have this year.
现在，这不是更近的，今年可能还会有。
But it certainly is 90 percent of the way between the Earth and the Moon, and it's called DX-110.
但它肯定是90%的地球和月球之间，而它被称为DX-110。

Dental X-rays
牙科X光
Little and not often, please
请不要太频繁,一点就好
Confirmation that dental X-rays can be bad for you
已证实牙科X光对你是有危害的
If you are a suspicious type you may be disturbed by the fact that, despite reassurances of the safety of the procedure, dentists and their technicians, when administering X-rays, usually step out of the room while the deed is done.
尽管牙科X光实施程序的安全已得到了证实，牙医和技工们还是会在拍X光时离开房间。如果你是一个多疑的人，这样的事实可能会困扰你。
Not only that, they often drape a lead-lined apron over your body to protect your vital organs. Well, all but one: your brain.
不但如此，在拍X光时他们还经常用铅衬的围裙盖住你的身体以保护重要器官—但是是除了大脑以外的所有器官。
A study by Elizabeth Claus, of Yale University, just published in Cancer, suggests your suspicions might be justified.
耶鲁大学的伊丽莎白.克劳斯医生的一项研究结果刚在癌症杂志上发表。此项研究表明你的怀疑可能并非杞人忧天。
Dr Claus thinks she has identified, in those who have had dental X-rays often, a significant rise in the admittedly small risk of developing a brain tumour.
克劳斯医认为她已发现那些经常拍牙科X光的病人得脑瘤的风险确实有显著升高。
In rich countries, five men in every 200,000, and twice as many women, develop tumours called meningiomas that affect the membranes surrounding the brain.
在富裕的国家里，每200，000人中就有5名男性得一种叫脑脊膜瘤的脑瘤，此瘤破坏脑膜，而且发病的女性人数是男性的两倍。
Meningiomas account for a third of primary brain tumours.
脑脊膜瘤的患者占原发性脑瘤患者的三分之一。
Only about 2% of them are malignant, but non-malignant does not mean non-dangerous.
只有2%的脑脊膜瘤是恶性的，但是非恶性并不代表没有危险。
Even a benign meningioma can kill.
即使是良性的脑脊膜瘤也会至死。
Around 30% do so within five years of diagnosis. 
大约30%的至死病例是发生在确诊后5年。
Symptoms can include seizures and blindness, and treatment may involve surgery, chemotherapy or, ironically, radiotherapy.
这种脑瘤的症状包括:痉挛和失明，可以通过手术，化疗，或者用放射疗法来进行治疗。
Ironically, because past research studying the after-effects of exposure to things like atom bombs and radiation treatments for cancer suggests the most important environmental risk factor for meningiomas is ionising radiation.
讽刺的是，对人体暴露于类似原子弹辐射和癌症放射疗法的后果的研究显示，产生脑脊膜瘤的最主要的环境风险因素是离子辐射。
These days, however, the main source of ionising radiation for most people is neither fallout from bombs nor radiotherapy; it is dental X-rays.
然而，现今影响大多数人的离子辐射的主要源头既不是原子弹的辐射尘埃也不是放射疗法，而是牙科X光。
Despite that, surprisingly little research has been done on those X-rays' effects.
尽管如此，令人惊讶的是几乎没有牙科X光对人类影响的研究。
Dr Claus and her colleagues have tried to plug the gap.
克劳斯医生和她的同事们已在努力填补这一空白。
They studied 1,433 Americans who have had meningiomas and compared them with 1,350 others who have not.
他们研究了1433名美国的脑脊膜瘤患者，并把他们与1350名非患者进行对比。
These others were chosen to match the study group's age profile, sex ratio and dwelling place.
这些被选择的非患者构成符合研究所需的年龄组成，性别比例和所在居住地。
The researchers then inquired about both groups' family, medical and dental histories.
研究人员获取了这两组研究对象的家庭，病史，和牙病史的数据。
In the case of their dental histories, participants were asked whether they generally had standard X-rays, known as bitewings, every year, or never had them, or fell somewhere in between.
对于牙病史，参与者被问及他们是否通常每年接受常规的牙医X光，或是从没拍过，或是介于以上两者之间。
They were also asked how often they had had panoramic X-rays—so-called panorexes—taken of their entire mouths, and whether they had ever had braces, the fitting of which often involves a panoramic X-ray.
他们还被问及拍全颌x光—对整个口腔拍摄X光的经常性，以及是否做过牙齿整形—通常是会要求拍全颌x光。
The researchers found that people who had had a meningioma were more than twice as likely as those who had not to have had at least one bitewing X-ray.
研究发现患脑脊膜瘤的病人发病的可能性是那些没拍过咬翼片的人的两倍以上。
And the more bitewings they had been given, the greater that likelihood was.
拍咬翼片次数越多的人，可能性越大。
Even more troubling was the finding that people who had been given a panorex when they were under ten had 4.9 times the normal risk of developing a meningioma.
更让人担忧的发现是十岁以下拍过全颌x光的人患脑脊膜瘤的概率是正常风险值的4.9倍。
To be fair, only 22 participants in the study had both had a panorex and developed such a tumour.
公平地说，只有22名研究参与者拍过全颌x光并患有脑脊膜瘤。
But according to Dr Claus, the panorex was not common when most of the people in the study had been children.
但据克劳斯医生说，以前研究对象大部分是儿童，拍全颌x光的现象并不普遍。
Nowadays, she says, before getting braces all the kids have it.
如今，她说，在牙齿整形之前所有儿童都拍过全颌x光了。
What these results mean in practice is debatable.
以上研究发现的实际意义还是有争议的。
The radiation dose from an individual dental X-ray, Dr Claus points out, has gone down by about half over the past 30 years or so.
克劳斯医生指出，单次牙医X光的辐射剂量已在过去的30年降低到原来的一半左右。
In addition, some dentists and orthodontists—though far from the majority—have turned to digital methods that expose patients to even lower levels. But others are using fancy new techniques like cone-beam computerised tomography which actually expose people to much higher levels of radiation.
另外，一些牙科医生和整牙医师—虽然并不占多数，已转用电子手段，这就更大程度的降低了病人所受的辐射程度。
Moreover, guidelines from the American Dental Association state that healthy adults should have a bitewing X-ray no more than once every two or three years, and that there is little reason to X-ray patients who do not have symptoms.
此外，美国牙科协会的指南规定健康成年人每两到三年不应拍超过一次的咬翼片，并且没有理由给无病症的病人拍X光。
These are policies which Dr Claus describes as quite reasonable.
克劳斯医生认为这些政策是很合理的。
But if what her participants told her is true, not all dentists are heeding their own professional body's advice.
如果研究参与者所告知的都是事实的话，可见并不是所有牙科医生都留心自身的建议。
Most of those who took part in the study reported having at least one X-ray a year.
大多数参与研究的人表示一年至少拍了一次x 光。
Dr Claus's work, then, is a timely reminder that X-rays are dangerous, that dentists should use them sparingly and that patients who have suspicions about their use are not necessarily paranoid.
克劳斯医生的工作及时地提醒了我们，拍x光是有危险的，牙医应该保守地使用它们，这样看来病人们对x光的疑虑并不是所谓的妄想。
A flat world sounds like something from the dark ages. 
“平坦的世界”听起来好像来自黑暗时代的东西。
Indeed, a world of flat oil prices could, for some, be a very unpleasant place. 
的确，平坦的油价世界，对某些国家来说将是一个非常不愉快的前景。
The lack of upward movement has already had an impact on the behaviour of major oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, Oman and Bahrain. 
油价缺乏上扬趋势，已经对主要产油国的行为产生了影响，例如沙特阿拉伯、卡塔尔、科威特、阿联酋、阿曼和巴林。
These nations have slowed the pace of budgetary expansion from a regional average of 14 per cent growth last year to less than 3 per cent this year.
这些国家放慢了预算扩张的步伐，从去年平均增长14%，降到今年的不到3%。
A report from Moody's calculates the Brent crude oil price required to generate the revenue needed to cover spending plans (the break-even price). 
穆迪(Moody's)的一份报告计算了要实现可覆盖支出计划的财政收入，布伦特原油价格（盈亏平衡价）需要有多高。
Since 2008 spending has more than kept pace with a doubling oil price. 
2008年以来，支出增速超过翻番的油价。
And those spending plans are still rising, even if the oil price is not. 
而这些支出计划仍在扩张，即便油价已经止步。
The UN forecasts that the labour force in the region will grow at 10 per cent annually until 2020. 
联合国预测，海湾地区的劳动力人数将以每年10%的速度增长至2020年。
Investment in job creation is crucial. 
创造就业机会的投资至关重要。
Significant spending cuts will be hard to push through. 
重大的开支缩减计划将难以推行。
For example, the break-even price for Oman is $100; for Bahrain it is $130. Oil is trading at $109.
例如，阿曼的盈亏平衡价是100美元；巴林是130美元。目前油价是109美元。
Should oil prices and regional government revenues suddenly drop, most of the Gulf nations can fall back on their sovereign wealth funds. 
一旦油价和海湾各国政府的财政收入骤降，多数海湾国家还可以依赖其主权财富基金。
Its SWF amounts to just two years of spending. 
其主权财富基金仅相当于两年的支出。
In Bahrain oil accounts for only a quarter of its GDP but it is 87 per cent of revenues. 
巴林的石油产值仅占其国内生产总值(GDP)的四分之一，但贡献了财政收入的87%。
It is the only Gulf economy running a budget deficit, as Bank of America points out. 
美国银行指出，巴林是海湾地区唯一运行预算赤字的经济体。
Since 2008 its debt to GDP ratio has more than doubled, to 61 per cent.
自2008年以来，其债务与GDP的比率已增加一倍多，达61%。
For now, oil is firm. 
就目前而言，油价仍属坚挺。
MSCI's index of Gulf country stock exchanges has risen by a tenth this year, partly on inflows into Qatar and UAE before their entry into MSCIﾒs Emerging Markets Index. 
摩根士丹利资本国际(MSCI)海湾国家股指今年迄今已上升10%，一部分原因是卡塔尔和阿联酋即将被纳入MSCI新兴市场股指，吸引外资流入。
Credit default swaps on Bahrain, a potential warning indicator, have pulled back since October, suggesting credit markets are unconcerned. But if the world stays flat, the pressure will rise.
针对巴林的信用违约互换（CDS，潜在的预警信号）的价格自去年10月以来已经下降，说明信用市场并不担心。但如果油价保持平坦，压力将会上升。
BP splits off US energy unit
BP成立新公司角逐美国能源业务
BP is creating a new business to manage its US onshore oil and gas assets, in an effort to compete more effectively with the smaller independent companies that dominate America’s shale industry.
英国石油(BP)即将创办一家新公司，来管理其在美国的陆上石油和天然气资产。此举旨在帮助BP更有效地与主导美国页岩气行业的中小规模独立企业展开竞争。
Analysts said BP could ultimately sell the new unit if its performance did not improve. 
分析师们表示，如果新成立的美国公司业绩得不到改善，BP最终仍可以把它卖掉。
Last year, the oil group said it planned to divest $10bn of assets by the end of next year – on top of the $38bn disposal programme implemented in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010.
去年，BP表示，它计划在2010年深水地平线事故后实施的380亿美元资产处置计划基础上，到明年底再剥离100亿美元的资产。
Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, played down the possibility of a sale, saying that the new US business “will remain a critical part of BP’s portfolio over the long term”. 
BP首席执行官戴德立(Bob Dudley)表示，BP不大可能卖掉这家新成立的美国公司，称其“长期而言仍将是BP资产组合中的一个关键组成部分”。
However, he added that the move “creates optionality for us”.
然而，他补充表示，此举“为我们提供了选择的机会”。
BP will own the US unit, but it will operate separately from the rest of the company, be led by a separate management team and publish separate financials from 2015.
新成立的美国公司将为BP所有，但该公司将与公司其余部分分开运营，由单独的管理团队领导，并从2015年起单独发布财报。
BP’s plan reflects the difficulties that oil majors including ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell have had in trying to make money from US shale gas. 
BP此项计划凸显出，包括埃克森美孚和荷兰皇家壳牌在内的石油大企业，在试图从美国页岩气盈利方面遇到重重困难。
All have been hit by the driving down of US natural gas prices caused by the shale boom.
页岩气繁荣压低了美国天然气价格，让这些大企业都受到冲击。
War fears decimate Russia stocks
战争阴云重创俄罗斯股市
Fears of a war in Ukraine wiped a 10th off the value of Moscow’s stock exchange and sent the rouble tumbling to an all-time low as the west scrambled to counter Russia’s creeping invasion of Crimea.
对乌克兰战争的担忧抹去了莫斯科股票交易所十分之一的市值，并导致卢布汇率跌至历史新低。与此同时，西方纷纷谴责俄罗斯对克里米亚逐渐升级的侵略行为。
Investors fled Russian assets, with stocks in Moscow falling by 10.8 per cent, their biggest daily fall since the 2008 financial crisis. 
投资者对俄罗斯资产的回避促使莫斯科股市下跌了10.8%，这是自2008年金融危机以来最大的单日跌幅。
Global markets also reacted to the prospect of a conflict and there was a jump in the price of commodities that are heavily dependent on Russia and Ukraine, such as wheat, oil and European natural gas.
全球市场也对发生冲突的可能性做出了回应，一些严重依赖俄罗斯和乌克兰的大宗商品——比如小麦、石油和欧洲天然气——价格飙升。
The rouble, already one of the worse performing currencies, fell nearly 3 per cent to a record low of Rbs36.90 against the dollar before the central bank surprised the market by raising rates and spending at least $7bn propping up the rouble.
本来就已是最疲软货币之一的卢布下跌近3%，跌至1美元兑36.90卢布的创纪录低点。随后俄罗斯央行出乎市场意料地提升了利率，并支出至少70亿美元支撑卢布汇率。
The market turmoil came as tensions continued to rise over Russia’s occupation of Crimea. 
市场动荡之际，俄罗斯对克里米亚的占领令紧张态势进一步加剧。
Ukraine’s defence ministry said its forces in Crimea had received an ultimatum from Russian forces to surrender to them by 5am local time today or face attack. 
乌克兰国防部表示，该国在克里米亚的部队接到了俄军的最后通牒，要求他们在今天当地时间凌晨5点前向俄军投降，否则将遭遇俄军攻击。
Russia dismissed the claims as “utter nonsense”.
俄罗斯方面否认了这一声明，称这是“一派胡言”。
The near 11 per cent slide in the rouble so far this year has raised fears of inflation in Russia, where people have painful memories of devaluations in 1997-98 and 2008-09.
今年迄今卢布汇率下滑近11%，这引发了对俄罗斯的通胀担忧。在俄罗斯，人们仍对1997-98年和2008-09年的卢布贬值有着痛苦记忆。
Economists said the combination of higher inflation, rising interest rates and capital flight could tip the struggling Russian economy into recession. 
经济学家们表示，在更高的通胀水平、不断攀升的利率以及资本外逃的共同作用下，本已困难重重的俄罗斯经济可能陷入衰退。
“This is a security shock which will push Russia into a mild recession,” Jacob Nell, chief Russia economist at Morgan Stanley.
摩根士丹利首席俄罗斯经济学家雅各布•内尔表示：“这个安全方面的冲击将令俄罗斯陷入轻度衰退。”
The impact rippled across global stock markets. 
由此产生的冲击波已传遍全球股市。
Equities tumbled as investors fled to safer assets such as government bonds. 
随着投资者寻求政府债券等更安全资产，股价出现了大幅下跌。
The FTSE All-World share index fell 1.4 per cent – reversing last week’s gains and by lunchtime in New York, the S&P 500 was down 1 per cent.
富时环球股票指数下跌了1.4%，逆转了上周的增幅。纽约收市时，标普500指数(S&P 500)下跌了0.74%。
Wheat leapt 4.7 per cent, Brent crude oil rose 2.1 per cent and UK natural gas futures jumped by nearly 10 per cent.
小麦价格跃升了4.7%，布伦特(Brent)原油价格上涨了2.1%，而英国天然气期货跃升了近10%。
The cost of insuring Ukrainian and Russian debt against a default jumped by 15 per cent.
针对乌克兰和俄罗斯债务违约的保险成本跃升了15%。
Cooper Tire takes $29m hit from Chinese strikes
中国罢工导致固铂轮胎损失2900万美元
Chinese industrial action cost Cooper Tire $29m in the three months to September 30, the Ohio-based company reported, shedding rare light on the economic impact of a labour dispute in China.
总部位于美国俄亥俄州的固铂轮胎报告称，中国的劳工行动导致其在截至去年9月30日的3个月期间损失2900万美元。这也让人罕见地一瞥中国劳资纠纷的经济影响。
While strikes are common across China, they typically occur at little-known suppliers. 
中国各地尽管经常发生罢工，但通常发生在不知名的供应商中。
On those rare occasions when labour unrest disrupts operations at a large multinational, the impact on a global company’s overall operations is usually not material enough to force disclosure about a specific strike’s financial cost.
少数发生在大型跨国公司中的劳工骚乱，对跨国公司整体运营的影响通常又不足以迫使其披露某一次罢工的财务成本。
The seven-month industrial action at Cooper’s joint venture Chengshan Tire factory in Shandong province derailed a $2.4bn bid by Apollo Tyres for Cooper, in what would have been the largest Indian takeover of a US company. 
发生在位于山东的固铂成山轮胎公司（固铂旗下的合资公司）的这场为时7个月的罢工，让阿波罗轮胎公司(Apollo Tyres)对固铂24亿美元的收购计划告吹。该笔收购原本会是印度对美国企业规模最大的一笔收购。
It also occurred at a facility that generates as much as one quarter of Cooper’s revenue and profit.
固铂有高达四分之一的营收和利润来自发生罢工的固铂成山。
In a delayed third-quarter earnings report, Cooper said the strike had cost it $22m in reduced production and a further $7m in “manufacturing inefficiencies”. 
在这份延迟发布的三季度盈利报告中，固铂表示，罢工导致其因减产损失2200万美元，因“生产效率低下”进一步损失700万美元。
The company incurred a further $5m in expenses related to the failed transaction during the quarter.
固铂在该季度还产生了500万美元与收购交易失败有关的费用。
The losses in Shandong contributed to a 25 per cent year-on-year fall in third-quarter sales, to $832m. 
受罢工事件的影响，固铂三季度销售额同比下跌25%，至8.32亿美元。
Operating profit contracted almost 80 per cent compared with 2012, to $28m. 
营运利润比2012年缩水近80%，至2800万美元。
Cooper reported a net loss of $168,000 for the July-September period, compared with a net profit of $74m a year earlier.
在7-9月期间，固铂报告净亏损16.8万美元，而上年同期该公司报告净盈利7400万美元。
Management and the workforce at Chengshan had opposed the proposed takeover by Apollo, arguing that it would saddle Cooper with too much debt.
固铂成山的管理层和工人反对阿波罗的收购计划，称收购会让固铂背上太多债务。
The campaign for Scottish Independence suffered a setback yesterday when two of the country’s biggest employers warned on the risks of a Yes vote, in a sign that companies are ready to break their silence on the issue.
苏格兰独立运动昨日遭遇一个挫折，苏格兰最大的两家雇主就独立带来的风险发出警告，这个迹象显示企业准备在这个问题上打破沉默。
Standard Life, the insurance company that employs 5,000 people north of the border, said constitutional changes could prompt it to shift large parts of operations out of Scotland in the most significant intervention by a big company.
在苏格兰拥有5000名雇员的保险公司标准人寿表示，宪法的改变可能促使它将大部分业务转移出苏格兰，这是一家大型企业在“苏独”问题上最重大的介入。
Royal Bank of Scotland, which has 12,000 staff in the country, also warned a vote for independence could damage its credit rating, although its chief executive insisted the group would remain “neutral” on the outcome of the referendum.
在苏格兰拥有1.2万名雇员的苏格兰皇家银行(RBS)也警告称，如果投票结果支持独立，可能损害该行信用评级，尽管该行首席执行官坚称，该行将对公投结果保持“中立”。
Until now few companies have been willing to enter the independence debate for fear of upsetting customers and staff. 
因为担心得罪顾客和员工，迄今没有几家企业愿意投入有关独立的辩论。
However, if opinion polls continue to show nationalists narrowing the gap ahead of the vote in September then groups worried about the implications are more likely to speak out.
然而，如果民意调查继续显示，在9月的公投临近之际，民族主义者不断缩小差距，那么担心独立后果的企业打破沉默的可能性会加大。
Standard Life, which has been based in Scotland since 1825, has started to register new entities in England, which would smooth any move south. 
自1825年起总部一直设在苏格兰的标准人寿，已开始在英格兰注册新的实体，这将为平稳“南下”做好准备。
The future of the currency is its biggest concern, say people familiar with the matter.
知情人士表示，苏格兰货币的前景是该公司最大的担忧。
The Royal Bank of Scotland said in its annual report: “A vote in favour of Scottish independence would be likely to significantly impact the group’s credit ratings.”
苏格兰皇家银行在年报中表示：“假如投票结果支持苏格兰独立，可能对本集团的信用评价造成重大影响。”
Second in size only to the City of London, the Scottish financial and professional services industry supports 150,000 jobs and accounts for nearly 13 per cent of the Scottish economy, says lobby group TheCityUK.
游说团体TheCityUK表示，苏格兰的金融和专业服务业在规模上仅次于伦敦金融城(City of London)，提供了15万就业岗位，占苏格兰经济的近13%。
China denies direct role in renminbi’s decline
中国官方否认策划人民币贬值
The renminbi has suffered its steepest weekly fall against the US dollar since China reformed its exchange rate system in 2005 in a move that some economists have interpreted as a warning from the country’s central bank to currency speculators.
人民币兑美元汇率出现自2005年中国实施汇改以来的最大单周跌幅。一些经济学家将这解读为中国央行对外汇投机者发出的一次警告。
The renminbi posted its seventh straight daily decline yesterday, sliding 0.02 per cent against the dollar to close at 6.1244 having hit its lowest level since early August in intraday trading.
昨日，人民币汇率连续第7天下跌，人民币兑美元汇率收跌0.02%，至1美元兑6.1244元人民币，盘中一度创下去年8月初以来的低点。
One popular theory among economists and investors is that the People’s Bank of China engineered the depreciation because it was concerned about huge inflows of capital in recent months and wanted to show markets that trading the currency was not a one-way bet. 
经济学家和投资者较认可的一个解读是，中国央行策划了这波人民币贬值，因为其对近几月的巨额资金流入感到担心，想向市场表明单向押注人民币汇率走势是行不通的。
Analysts had been forecasting a continuation of the appreciation seen since late 2012.
2012年末以来，分析师一直预测人民币会持续升值。
However, the Chinese central bank used its first official statement on the sudden weakening of the country’s currency to say the sell-off was a reflection of market forces and should not be over-interpreted.
然而，中国央行在其就人民币突然贬值发表的首份官方声明中表示，这是市场力量的反映，不应过分解读。
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, an agency under the central bank, did not acknowledge any role in guiding the currency. 
中国央行下属的中国国家外汇管理局不承认在引导汇率走势方面发挥了什么作用。
“The recent movement of the renminbi exchange rate is the result of market players adjusting their near-term trading strategies,” it said.
该局表示：“近期人民币汇率走势是市场主体调整前期人民币交易策略的结果。
“The degree of exchange rate volatility is normal by the standards of developed and emerging markets.”
“这次汇率波动幅度与发达和新兴市场货币的波动相比属于正常波动。
After huge investment and trade inflows at the start of the year, there was a clear reversal of the trend in February, according to China Financial News, a central bank newspaper.
中国央行主管的报纸《金融时报》报道称，在今年初出现巨大的投资与贸易流入之后，2月份趋势发生了明显的逆转。
“Risk appetite has weakened somewhat because of lower-than-expected growth data. Also, concerns about the property market have increased,” said Peng Wensheng, an economist with China International Capital Corp, the research group.
中国国际金融公司(CICC)经济学家彭文生说：“风险偏好下降的原因多少在于逊于预期的增长数据。另外，房地产市场引起的担忧也有所加剧。”
However, the hand of the ­Chinese central bank, which keeps a tight grip on the exchange rate, has been evident. 
然而，一直严格管控汇率的中国央行在这波人民币贬值中的作用是显而易见的。
When the currency started falling last week it was the central bank that steadily lowered its daily reference rate, while banks and companies continued to trade it at a stronger level.
上周人民币汇率开始下跌时，是中国央行在稳步下调人民币汇率中间价，而银行和企业则在不断将人民币汇率水平推高至中间价上方。
It was only over the past two days that the market-traded exchange rate fell below the daily rate set by the central bank – a sign that Beijing has, for now, succeeded in breaking at least some of the one-way bets on appreciation.
只是在过去两天里，市场交易给出的人民币汇率才降至中国央行设定的中间价下方。这一迹象表明，北京方面目前至少在一定程度上打破了人民币单边升值预期。
China faced immense capital inflows at the start of this year, according to data published on Tuesday by the central bank.
中国央行周二发布的数据显示，今年初流入中国的资金规模十分庞大。
Banks bought a net $73bn of foreign currency in the onshore market from their clients who wanted renminbi in January, the biggest monthly amount on record. 
今年1月，银行在在岸市场从想持有人民币的客户手中净买入了730亿美元的外汇，创下了最大的单月买入量。
Inflows have been accelerating since the middle of last year when China’s mountain of foreign exchange reserves grew by $500bn to $3.8tn.
去年年中，中国的巨额外汇储备增加了5000亿美元，达到3.8万亿美元。自那以来，资金一直在加速流入中国。
Beijing faces up to failure in Xinjiang
昆明暴恐袭击考验中国新疆政策 
The dramatic failure of China’s containment strategy for a long-running insurgency in the remote northwestern region of Xinjiang poses a grave policy challenge for Beijing.
针对西北偏远地区新疆持续多年的叛乱，中国采取的遏制战略遭遇戏剧性的失败，这给北京方面带来严重的政策挑战。
The conflict, involving Muslim Uighurs who object to Chinese control of their energy-rich homeland, burst into the country’s heartland in a terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 33 people in the southwestern city of Kunming on Saturday night. 
矛盾的一方是反对中国控制其能源丰富的家园的维吾尔族穆斯林。这一矛盾上周六晚间在中国腹地爆发：地处中国西南的昆明市遭遇恐怖袭击，导致33人丧生。
The deadly assault by machete-wielding assailants, who struck at the city’s main railway station, also raises questions about whether the Chinese government’s hardline response to Uighur “separatism” has succeeded only in creating a more intractable crisis.
挥舞砍刀的袭击者在该市主要火车站发起的血腥攻击还令人质疑：中国政府对维吾尔“分裂主义”的强硬回应，是否只是成功地制造了一场更加棘手的危机？
Last night the official Xinhua news agency said Chinese police had arrested three people involved in the attack and identified the group’s leader as Abdurehim Kurban. 
官方的新华社昨晚称，中国警方已逮捕3名参与攻击的人员，并确定这个团伙的头目是阿不都热依木▪库尔班。
Authorities killed another four suspects and apprehended a fifth at the railway station on Saturday.
警方上周六在火车站当场击毙另外4名犯罪嫌疑人，并抓获一人。
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but Beijing has always maintained its conflict in Xinjiang is with unspecified “separatist” elements rather than with “Uighur” activists. 
没有任何组织声称对这次袭击负责，但北京方面一贯坚称，其在新疆的斗争对象是未指明的“分裂主义”分子，而不是“维吾尔”活动人士。
The distinction is important because it suggests that external or hostile forces – rather than the government’s own policies – are to blame for tensions in strategically important regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.
这种区别很重要，因为它暗示，具有重要战略意义的地区（如新疆和西藏）的紧张局势要归咎于境外敌对势力，而不是中国政府自身的政策。
More than 100 people were killed in clashes in Xinjiang last year, mostly in remote areas where conflicting accounts of the incidents could not be independently checked.
去年新疆发生的若干冲突导致100多人丧生。这些冲突大多发生在偏远地区，有关具体事件相互矛盾的报道无法得到独立核实。
The massacre in Kunming is the second time the conflict has spilled beyond Xinjiang’s borders since October, when three Uighurs drove a vehicle into a crowd in Tiananmen Square. 
昆明发生的大屠杀是去年10月以来这一矛盾第二次蔓延至新疆以外。去年10月，3名维族人驾车在天安门广场冲撞人群。
Although a highly symbolic attack at the centre of China’s capital, it killed only two bystanders.
虽然那是一起发生在中国首都市中心的具有高度象征意义的攻击，但它仅导致两名路人丧生。 
Saturday’s mass killing, by contrast, was shocking for both its location and its death toll. 
与此形成对照的是，上周六发生的大屠杀在地点和死亡人数两方面都令人震惊。
In Kunming yesterday clear blue skies and blooming flowers added to the sense of disbelief at what had occurred less than 48 hours earlier.
昨日昆明天气晴朗、鲜花盛开，令人对不到48小时前发生的惨剧更加觉得难以置信。
“The number of casualties and the impact of the violence are unprecedentedly high,” said Li Wei, an antiterrorism expert at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations.
“伤亡人数和暴力行为的冲击力都达到空前的高度，”中国现代国际关系研究院反恐问题专家李伟表示。
“The terrorist threat is clearly moving beyond Xinjiang. The attack was carefully organised and planned. The people involved had been well trained.”
“恐怖威胁显然正蔓延到新疆以外。这次袭击是经过精心组织策划的。参与者之前受到良好的训练。”
The savage nature of what some state media have called “China’s 9/11” was on graphic display on the ninth floor of the Number one Kunming People’s Hospital, where victims of the terror attack are recovering.
此次恐怖袭击的一些受害者在昆明市第一人民医院九楼接受治疗，一些官方媒体所称的“中国的9?11事件”的野蛮性在这里可见一斑。
Most of the wounded were slashed in the head, their shaven scalps now criss-crossed with long scars and stitches.
大部分伤员都是头部被砍伤，他们剃光头发的头皮上满是纵横交错的长疤痕和缝线。
Cao Nian described the moment when his 23-year-old girlfriend, Wang Hongli, was struck in the back of the head. 
曹念描述了他23岁的女友王鸿丽后脑被砍中的那一刻。
“I was seeing her off at the station when [the attackers] appeared,” he said. 
“我在车站给她送行，就在这时（攻击者）出现了。”他说。
“First there was one, then six. We were crouching down when they hit her.” The two staggered out of the station, running some 400 metres to find medical help.
“起初是一个人，然后出现了六个人。我们蹲下来时，他们砍中了她。”两人踉踉跄跄逃出车站，跑了大约400米才得到救护。
Mr Cao, who was not injured in the attack, spoke as another casualty was wheeled by his sleeping girlfriend. 
未在袭击中受伤的曹念说话时，一辆推车从他熟睡的女友身旁推过，车上是另一名伤者。
A deep scar cut across the right side of the victim’s head, which had been stitched. 
此人头部右侧有一道深深的伤痕，伤口已被缝合。
A pool of blood was still evident in his ear.
他的耳内仍有明显的血块。
“We are all appalled by this tragedy,” said Na Zhouhuai, a Muslim trader from China’s Hui ethnic group, as he waited for midday prayers to begin at the Shuncheng mosque. 
“我们都对这场悲剧感到震惊，”纳舟怀（音译）表示。他是一名回族商人，此刻正在顺城清真寺等待正午祈祷开始。
“They killed ordinary people – ordinary people like us here. We believe that you should not even kill an ant.”
“他们杀害了普通人——像我们这样的普通人。我们相信，你甚至不应该杀死一只蚂蚁。”
There was no police presence outside Mr Na’s mosque and surprisingly modest security at Kunming’s railway station, which was again crowded with travellers.
顺城清真寺外似乎没有警察执勤，昆明火车站的安保也令人惊讶的宽松，这里再次挤满了旅客。
A banner outside the Shuncheng mosque in Kunming’s city centre urges worshippers to “strengthen ethnic relations and unity, construct a harmonious society”.
在地处昆明市中心的顺城清真寺外，一块横幅标语敦促信徒加强民族关系和团结、建设和谐社会。
While a large number of police vans were parked near Dashuying, a mixed Uighur and Hui neighbourhood, officers were not visible on the streets.
虽然在维族和回族聚集的大树营附近停着大量警车，但街上几乎看不见警察。
“People are scared and business is down,” one restaurant owner said. “They rounded up some Uighurs here on Sunday.” 
“人们都很害怕，生意下滑了。”一名餐馆老板说，“上周日他们在这里抓了一些维族人。”
The detentions could not be confirmed. 
这些拘留无法得到证实。
Elsewhere, however, there were signs of a possible backlash brewing on the eve of the annual two-week session of China’s national parliament.
但在其他地方，在中国全国人大和政协举行年会前夕，有迹象显示一场可能的反弹正在酝酿当中。
Li Fangping, a human rights lawyer representing a prominent Uighur scholar charged on Wednesday last week with separatist offences, posted on his blog a copy of a police notice from Nanning, another city in China’s southwest, asking local residents to report the arrival of any Uighur residents, businessmen or tourists in the area. 
上周三，一位知名维族学者以分裂罪被提起公诉。李方平是代表这位学者的人权律师，他在自己的博客上贴出了中国西南城市南宁警方的一份通知。通知要求当地居民报告到达该市的任何维族居民、商人或游客。
Nanning police declined to comment on the notice.
南宁警方拒绝就此份通知置评。
“This is a reaction to the central government’s top-down demand for stability. It’s their usual way of doing things,” said Mr Li.
“这是对中央政府自上而下的维稳要求的一个反应。这是他们一贯的办事方式，”中国现代国际关系研究院的李伟表示。
“It’s an illegal and exaggerated response that won’t solve the crisis and will just make things worse.”
“这是一种非法和夸张的反应，不会解决危机，只会使事情变得更糟。”
Big Brother can watch me at work any day
你愿意上班被监控吗？ 
Last week the Financial Times published a scary story about how technology is being used by companies to spy on us at work. 
上周英国《金融时报》报道了公司如何利用技术在工作中监控我们的可怕故事。
It described how sensors can be easily and cheaply hidden in name badges and office furniture to track where we are, who we talk to and in what tone of voice. 
它描述了公司如何不费力、不费钱，偷偷将传感器藏在胸牌或办公室家具里，来记录我们的位置、我们与谁交谈、乃至用何种语气交谈。
HR departments can find out how long we take to get to work and how we behave when we get there. 
人力资源部门可以知道我们休息多久后才开始工作，以及我们是如何工作的。
In shops, call centres and even boardrooms, the data could be used to decide who to promote and who to fire.
在商店、呼叫中心甚至是董事会会议室，这些数据可能被用来决定提拔谁、解雇谁。
I shuddered as I read the article – as did most FT readers. 
当我读到这篇文章时感到不寒而栗，本报的许多读者也是如此。
Nineteen Eighty-Four is upon us, they commented online. 
他们在网上评论说，“1984”(Nineteen Eighty-Four)来临了。
Totalitarianism is rampant! Privacy is down the plughole! 
极权主义泛滥！隐私被抛进了下水道！
(Some of the comments are published in “Feedback” below).
（其中一些发表在文章下面的“评论”中）。
Yet on closer inspection, the arrival of Big Brother in the corporate world is not necessarily such a bad thing. 
然而，进一步深入思索就会发现，“老大哥”(Big Brother)来到企业世界不一定有多么糟糕。
Being constantly monitored by invisible devices might sound frightening but I’m not sure it is any more so than being monitored infrequently by visible human beings.
受到隐形装置无时不刻的监控听起来或许有些可怕，但我不敢肯定它会比主管偶尔现身的监控更可怕。
Under the present arrangement, we are observed in a haphazard and unscientific way by superiors who may well have made up their minds about us already, based on not much evidence at all. 
从当前的情况来看，我们的主管正以一种随意而不科学的方式观察着我们，他们很可能已经对我们有了定论，却根本不以多少证据为依据。
Sod’s Law decrees that when you do something good, no one notices but the minute you do something bad you get caught. 
按照“索德定律”，当你做好事时，没有人会注意到；但当你干坏事，就会被抓个现行。
I remember one boss who, once in a blue moon, would walk around the office; whenever he crept up behind me I was invariably writing a shopping list or was on the phone to my mum. 
我记得有位老板很少会在办公室四处走动；但每次他悄无声息地出现在我的身后，我总是在列购物清单或者与我的妈妈通电话。
Such surveillance didn’t improve my behaviour, though it did increase my sense of injustice. 
这样的监控不会提高我的工作表现，却着实让我感觉冤枉。
To have been monitored all the time – which would have put the shopping list in the context of otherwise diligent behaviour – would have been a vast improvement.
而如果我是一直处于监控下，那么老板会在考虑我列购物清单的同时，考虑我在其它时间勤勉工作的表现，这样我就会大幅改进自己的表现。
In most offices a raft of mainly pointless, cumbersome tools are used to assess performance, including “competency matrices”, appraisal interviews and psychometric testing. 
在大多数的办公室里，一大堆基本毫无意义而且繁琐的工具被用来评估员工的表现，包括“能力矩阵”、考核面谈和心理测试。
Together they are so ineffective that according to a delightful piece of research by the University of Catania, companies would be no worse off promoting people at random.
总的来说它们的效果很差，差到根据卡塔尼亚大学一份令人愉悦的研究报告，企业随意提拔员工，也不会比根据这些评估结果提拔员工糟糕。
If we are in favour of meritocracies, we should also be in favour of anything that helps us measure merit more accurately. 
如果我们支持唯才是举，那么也就应该支持有助于更准确衡量工作表现的任何举措。
While the data collected by the new sensors are almost certainly too crude to offer much help now, I see no reason why in time (and probably quite soon) we will not have worked out exactly which behavioural quirks are the key to high (or low) performance, and found a decent, objective way of measuring them.
尽管几乎可以肯定，传感器收集的数据过于粗糙而帮助不大，但我看不出有什么原因能阻止我们在未来某一天（很可能相当快），搞清楚哪一种行为上的怪癖是导致员工表现优秀或糟糕的关键因素，并找出一种得体而客观地衡量员工表现的方式。
Steelcase, which makes some of the sensors so loathed by FT readers, hopes that one day they will not only be used to monitor juniors but in boardrooms too. 
引起英国《金融时报》读者极度反感的一些传感器是Steelcase制造的。该公司希望，总有一天这些传感器不仅用来监控初级员工，而且还会被用在董事会会议室。
While it is hard to see directors willingly turning these tools upon themselves, it would be a terrific idea if they did. 
尽管很难想象董事们会愿意将这些工具用于监控自己，但如果他们真的愿意的话，那这个想法棒极了。
At the moment, monitoring of boardroom behaviour is hopeless – outsiders periodically come in to observe, but such are the political sensitivities it is almost impossible for them to make a difference.
就目前而言，根本做不到监控董事们在董事会会议室内的行为——外部人士偶尔会评论几句，但这种事情在政治上极度敏感，他们几乎不可能带来什么改变。
If, by contrast, all directors were wired up, anyone who banged on indefinitely, lowering the pulses of their boardroom colleagues, would be faithfully fingered by the technology. 
话说回来，如果所有董事都受到监控，任何喋喋不休地说个不停、让会议室里的其他董事昏昏欲睡的人，都会被监控忠实地揭发出来。
Equally, the person who made the odd remark that made everyone sit up in their seats would also be marked out. 
同样，说出一个新奇观点、让所有人一下子来了精神的那个人，也会被记录下来。
Knowing that the devices were there, and knowing the object of the exercise was to make incisive, controversial points, would improve board meetings no end.
当董事们知道有监控设备在，也知道这种做法的目的是让他们提出入木三分、值得争论的观点，董事会会议的质量将得到极大改善。
It is objected that monitoring behaviour in offices would kill trust and spontaneity, making robots of us all. 
有人反对说，办公室的监控行为将会扼杀信任和主动性，让我们所有人都变成机器人。
But so long as everyone knew they were being monitored and understood what for, I don’t see why it should be such a terrifying idea – except perhaps for those who bully, shout at and harass others – and who have been getting away with it.
但只要所有人都知道他们正受到监控，而且也明白监控的目的，我认为人们就不应如此害怕监控——或许除了那些欺凌、叱喝和骚扰其他同事的人，以及一直在躲避监控的人以外。
Far from making work less civilised, the arrival of Big Brother could make it more so. 
“老大哥”的来临可能会促进、而非降低人们在工作中的文明程度。
Office life could become more transparent and less political. 
办公室生活可能变得更加透明而且减少了争权夺利。
And managers would be freed from having to play the role of policeman all day and allowed to get on with the more important role of helping people do a better job.
经理们将不用全天扮演警察的角色，从而可以发挥帮助人们提高工作效率的更重要的作用。
Some problems would need resolving. 
一些问题需要得到解决。
For a start extensive monitoring could be illegal. 
首先大规模监控可能是非法的。
You would also have to ensure that workers were not able to subvert the process – and that wicked managers were not busily manipulating the data for their own devious ends.
你还必须确保员工不能破坏监控过程，以及品格低下的经理不会为了自己不可告人的目的而忙着操纵数据。
Above all, for the system to work, you would need to have some faith in the regime that implemented it. 
最重要的是，要想让监控系统奏效，你就需要对实施它的整套管理制度有一些信心。
But then, if you don’t have any faith in the regime, the chances are that you are screwed anyway.
但如果你对管理制度没有丝毫信心，不管怎样你都可能搞砸。
New steel plants cast doubt on China’s emission control plan
新增钢铁产能挑战中国治污计划 
Steel plant closures central to the Chinese government’s plan for cutting pollution are likely to be outpaced by steel mills under construction, casting doubt on Beijing’s ability to make headway against air pollution enveloping northern China.
关停钢厂是中国政府减少污染计划的核心环节，但其关门的步伐可能赶不上钢铁产能扩张的步伐，这令人质疑中国政府抗击华北地区空气污染的行动能否取得进展。
On Wednesday, Beijing was again gripped by the thick grey pall that has lingered over northern China for more than a week. 
周三，北京再一次被浓浓的雾霾笼罩，这场雾霾覆盖华北地区的时间已超过一个礼拜。
Public anger over air pollution has spurred the government to speed up the release of air monitoring data, and could strengthen the hand of environmental regulators in shutting down powerful polluters.
民众对空气污染的愤怒，促使政府加快了发布空气质量监测数据的频率，并可能促使环境监管机构关停有势力排污企业的力度增强。
About 30m tonnes of new steel capacity across the country is still under construction, double the 15m tonnes of cuts pledged for 2014 by Hebei province, the industrial heartland surrounding Beijing which accounts for about a quarter of Chinese steel capacity.
目前中国全国范围内在建的钢铁产能约3000万吨，比河北省2014年承诺削减的1500万吨产能多一倍。河北省是环绕北京的工业大省，钢产能占全中国的四分之一左右。
Hebei agreed to the cuts as part of a national plan to reduce polluting emissions in the North China plain, where pollution regularly exceeds national standards.
华北平原的污染情况一直比全国标准严重。为服从一项旨在减少华北平原污染物排放的全国计划，河北省同意削减钢产能。
State media showed footage of steel mills and cement plants being destroyed to underline the government’s resolve. 
官方媒体播放了拆除钢厂和水泥厂的画面，以凸显政府的决心。
About 8m tonnes of capacity have been permanently closed down in Hebei since the plan was announced.
自计划宣布以来，河北已永久关停约800万吨钢铁产能。 
But so far, it is the least powerful polluters that have taken it on the chin. 
但迄今为止，被关停的只不过是那些实力最弱的排污企业。
“Generally speaking, the mills that have closed are older and unprofitable,” Wang Jiguang, a sales director at Hebei Iron and Steel Group, one of China’s largest steel producers, said at an iron ore conference organised by Metal Bulletin in Beijing. 
在英国《金属导报》于北京举办的一次铁矿石行业会议上，中国规模最大的钢铁制造商之一——河北钢铁集团营销管理处处长王继光说：“总体来说，到目前为止关停的都只是些陈旧落后、不赚钱的钢厂。”
Most of them have actually been idle for six months to a year already due to economic reasons.
其中大多数其实已经因为经济原因停产了6个月到1年。
Hebei pledged to cut its steel capacity by 60m tonnes by 2017, as part of a negotiated deal to reduce emissions in northern China, the Yangtze Delta and the Pearl River Delta while encouraging industrial investment in the arid west.
河北省承诺在2017年底前削减6000万吨钢铁产能，这是一项经过协商的方案的一部分，根据该方案，中国将减少华北、长三角和珠三角的污染物排放，同时鼓励企业在贫瘠的西部投资发展工业。
Meanwhile, the central government set up a $1.6bn fund to reward industry that complies with emission cuts, in recognition of the local jobs and taxes generated by polluting companies. 
与此同时，考虑到污染排放企业对当地就业和税收的贡献，中央政府设立了一项16亿美元的专项资金，用于奖励污染减排达标的企业。
It is expected to transfer about $330m to Hebei province, which is also the source of most of Beijing’s power supply.
专项资金预计将拨给河北省约3.3亿美元。北京的电力主要由该省供应。
Past attempts by central planning agencies to reduce industrial capacity by fiat have similarly ended in tears, as plant bosses and the banks that lend to them almost always chose to expand rather than face closure.
中央规划部门以往试图通过行政指令削减工业产能的举措同样以失败告终，因为工厂老板和为工厂提供贷款的银行几乎总是会选择扩张产能，而不是坐等被关闭。
Allowing the market to cull the inefficient producers has proved even more difficult in China, as state-owned steel companies are generally the worst performers. 
事实证明，在中国，让市场来淘汰缺乏效率的生产商更加困难，因为国有钢铁企业通常业绩最差。
Nearly every inland steel producer with more than 5m tonnes of capacity – in other words, at least a dozen of China’s biggest and most politically powerful mills – are losing money, according to industry expert Xu Zhongbo of Beijing Metal Consulting Ltd, with the exception of mills that have invested in automotive steel.
除了投资生产汽车用钢的钢厂以外，据北京梅塔科咨询公司总裁许中波表示，内地产能在500万吨以上的钢铁制造商——也就是中国规模最大、最有政治势力的十数家钢铁企业——几乎全都在亏损。 
Policies directly tied to reducing pollution rather than cutting industrial capacity have generally been more effective. 
把政策目标直接放在减少污染、而不是削减工业产能，效果通常更好。
For instance, about a decade ago China ordered the phase-out of the heavily polluting Soderberg process at aluminium smelters, and smelters were duly upgraded.
例如，中国约10年前下令电解铝行业淘汰污染严重的自焙槽技术，铝厂都改造了设备。
Power plants across China have installed emissions scrubbers, and have become more willing to use them in recent years after power subsidies were tweaked to reward their operation.
近年来，中国各地发电厂都在安装涤气器，而且随着政府修改发电补贴规则、奖励使用涤气装置的做法，电厂也就更有意愿安装这类装置。
China’s mobile sector grows up superfast
中国移动手机快速增长
The bustling shopping streets of Shanghai drive home the image of a country glued to mobile devices, often at the expense of passers-by shouldered out of the way by workers hurrying past with smartphone in hand.
走在上海喧闹的商业街上，路人常常会被手持智能手机、步履匆匆的上班族撞到肩膀。这个国度已经须臾离不开移动设备，上海的街道就是一个缩影。
The Chinese telecoms market was equally as urgent for the 75,000 people who descended on a bustling Barcelona last week for the industry’s biggest annual conference.
对于正在召开的世界移动通信大会，中国电信市场的心情和7.5万名与会者的心情一样急切。这些与会者们上周来到熙熙攘攘的巴塞罗那，参加这个全球电信业最大的年度展会。
While Europeans and Americans have had superfast 4G services for several years, the close to a billion people signed up to China Mobile, the world’s largest mobile carrier, are only now being given their first sight of so-called 4G or LTE technology.
欧洲和美国享受超高速的4G服务已有好几年时间了，而世界最大的移动运营商中国移动(China Mobile)的近10亿用户，直到最近才刚刚迎来所谓4G或LTE技术。
But such is the scale and speed at which China’s telecoms industry moves, driven by state policy, that there are already more 4G mobile masts installed in China than in the whole of Europe. 
不过，在国家政策的推动下，中国建成的4G移动基站的数量已超过整个欧洲。中国电信业发展的规模和速度由此可见一斑。
This gap will widen with a further wave of large tenders expected by the leading equipment makers in the next few months.
未来几个月，中国预计将面对主要设备制造商展开新一轮大规模招标，这将拉大中欧之间的差距。
China’s adoption of 4G is not just a story about bringing faster internet speeds to the most populous nation. 
4G技术给这个人口最多的国家带来的不仅是更快的网速。
The type of 4G technology – a standard called TD-LTE – used by China Mobile and its rivals means there are wide-ranging ramifications for device makers such as Apple and Samsung and telecoms equipment makers such as Ericsson and Nokia. 
中国移动及其竞争对手使用的4G技术类型——称为TD-LTE标准——将对苹果(Apple)、三星(Samsung)等手机制造商和爱立信(Ericsson)、诺基亚(Nokia)等电信设备厂商产生广泛影响。
Not to mention homegrown technology champions such as Huawei, which is benefiting more than most from the country’s telecoms boom.
更不用提华为(Huawei)等得益于中国电信业繁荣发展的本土科技领军企业了。
“The telecoms industry has been the poster child of the Chinese economic boom. A global standard based on a Chinese design is a prestige thing, and also an economic boon to the Chinese telecoms vendors,” says Tom Mowat, lead analyst for Analysys Mason’s Asia-Pacific team.
咨询公司Analysys Mason亚太团队首席分析师汤姆•莫厄特说：“电信业是中国经济繁荣的有力例证。基于‘中国设计’的一个全球标准，是很有影响力的，也会给中国电信商带来了经济利益。”
Need for speed
不断加速
4G technology is capable of delivering the internet over mobile phones almost instantly, opening up a host of services and applications as well as a vast market for western technology groups such as Apple, which will finally be able to sell its iPhones to China Mobile’s 750m customers.
4G技术可在移动电话上实现近乎实时的网络传输，为一大批服务和应用铺平了道路，也为苹果等西方科技企业打开了广阔的市场。随着中国使用4G技术，苹果最终得以向中国移动的7.5亿用户出售iPhone。
“By 2016, we estimate that China Mobile will be used for one in ten handsets globally,” says Mr Mowat.
莫厄特说：“我们估计，到2016年，全球每10部手机中，就会有一部使用中国移动的网络。”
The rapid adoption of superfast internet technology underscores the country’s economic and social development. 
对超高速网络技术的迅速采纳，凸显了中国经济和社会的发展。
While Chinese companies were previously seen as cheap imitators of western groups, the introduction of superfast networks has meant new web-orientated businesses such as WeChat and Alibaba are already competing with Silicon Valley rivals.
尽管中国企业曾被视为西方企业的廉价模仿者，但引入超高速网络意味着，以网络为导向的新公司——例如微信(WeChat)和阿里巴巴(Alibaba)——已经与硅谷的竞争对手们展开较量了。
This is not the first time China has sought to take a lead with its telecoms networks. 
中国试图以自身标准引领全球电信业发展，这不是第一回。
The battle for the 3G market has been fought with unblinking perseverance between GSM and CDMA standards over the past decade. 
10年来，在中国3G市场上，GSM和CDMA两种标准间的市场争夺战从未停止过。
China Mobile, which favoured the TD-CDMA standard, lost. Most global networks now conform to GSM.
支持TD-SCDMA标准的中国移动败下阵来。大多数国际网络现在采纳GSM标准。
This is why there was no iPhone on China Mobile’s network for so many years and why visitors to the Beijing Olympics complained about the poor mobile service at such an important event.
这就是中国移动为何这么多年来都不支持iPhone的原因。难怪北京奥运会的访客们抱怨，这样一场重大活动的移动服务太差劲了。
“The government had to force it down the throat of China Mobile and even then the company could not really make it work,” says Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA, an inward investment group.
中国本土咨询公司博达克(BDA)的董事长邓肯•克拉克说：“中国政府强迫中国移动使用本土设计的TD标准，但中国移动没能真正将这项标准发展起来。”
With 4G, China’s TD standard is not necessarily a competing technology to the more common FDD-LTE technology, since both can coexist in handsets. 
就4G而言，中国的TD标准不必与更通行的FDD-LTE技术竞争，因为二者可以兼容于4G手机。
Equipment makers will not be forced to choose between competing technologies – and as such will give the TD standards a far higher chance of success. 
设备制造商不必被迫在相互竞争的技术中做出选择，这给TD标准带来了更大的成功机会。
The Chinese market is also more mature now, and the sheer scale of the rollout this time involving all three of the country’s telecoms groups means there is a much higher chance of putting the TD technology at the heart of the global telecoms market.
中国的市场如今也更为成熟，此次新技术的推广规模如此巨大，涵盖了国内全部三家电信运营商，意味着TD技术登上全球电信市场中心舞台的机会大大提高了。
Standards battle
标准争夺战 
The scale of the 4G programme gives the adopted standard momentum – and China the opportunity to take the lead in the next generation of global broadband technology.
中国4G项目的规模之大，能给其采纳的TD标准带来蓬勃生机，也为中国创造了引领全球下一代宽带技术发展的契机。
In a growing battle over future technology standards, analysts say China is sponsoring the less popular form of technology through widespread domestic take-up. 
分析人士表示，未来技术标准之争正愈演愈烈，中国正通过国内的广泛推广来扶持它自己开发的相对冷门的技术标准。
There are only about 17 TD-LTE mobile networks commercially available worldwide – or one in 40 LTE connections globally.
目前，全世界只有大约17个TD-LTE类型的商用移动网络，而TD-LTE连接数只占全球LTE连接总数的2.5%。 
“The world’s largest operator running this sort of network immediately turns [TD-LTE] into a very successful global standard,” says Mr Mowat.
莫厄特表示：“运营这类网络的全世界最大运营商，会立刻把（TD-LTE）变成极为成功的全球标准。”
Division of the spoils
利益分配
There are some ironies in China’s bold ambitions for the introduction of superfast mobile broadband, given the internet can be incredibly slow because of the “Great Firewall” that blocks or filters foreign sites.
颇为讽刺的是，在中国展示其建设超高速移动宽带的宏大抱负的同时，中国“长城防火墙(Great Firewall)”对外国网站的封禁和过滤，却可能会把中国互联网网速降到难以置信的低水平。
But the speed of the rollout needs to be seen in the context of a telecoms industry largely controlled by the state.
不过，衡量4G在中国的推广速度，要考虑一个大背景，那就是电信行业在很大程度上由中国政府把控。 
“China Mobile has $65bn on its balance sheet so it can afford to build out very quickly. The government sees its balance sheet as a useful tool,” says Tucker Grinnan, regional head of telecoms for HSBC in Asia.
汇丰银行(HSBC)亚洲分行电信方面的区域主管塔克•格里南(Tucker Grinnan)表示：“中国移动的资产负债表规模达650亿美元，它有足够财力开展极为迅速的扩建工程。中国政府将该公司的资产规模视为一个有用工具。”
Much of the work to build the 4G network has been won by Chinese groups such as Huawei and ZTE, which deny direct links to the state.
4G网络的建设大部分由华为(Huawei)和中兴(ZTE)等中国集团承担，不过它们都否认与政府有直接关系。
Western groups such as Ericsson, NSN and Alcatel-Lucent have won sizeable contracts, but some of their executives have expressed dissatisfaction about China Mobile awarding all three western manufacturers a seemingly arbitrary 11 per cent each of its Rmb20bn ($3.25bn) 4G contract.
爱立信、诺基亚西门子通信(NSN)和阿尔卡特-朗讯(Alcatel-Lucent)等西方公司也赢得了规模相当大的合同。不过，中国移动4G合同总规模为200亿元人民币(合32.5亿美元），以上三家公司都只分到了11%的份额，而中国移动表现得十分专断。为此，这三家公司的部分高管已表达了不满。
Beyond 4G
4G之后 
Chinese technology groups are not stopping at 4G in the race for industry leadership, with Huawei committing significant resources to the next generation of so-called “5G” technology.
在争夺行业领导地位的比赛中，中国技术企业没有止步于4G，华为已把大量资源投资于下一代的所谓“5G”技术。
CCS Insight, a UK-based research group, predicts China will become the leader in next-generation mobile technology in the next two years, leaving behind a Europe where authorities are belatedly pushing the industry to invest “to regain former glory”.
总部位于英国的研究集团CCS Insight预计，今后两年，中国将成为下一代移动技术的领头羊，将欧洲甩在后面。在欧洲，当局正推动电信业加大投资“以恢复昔日荣光”，但这一举措可谓姗姗来迟。
Huawei said that by 2018 it would invest at least $600m in research into 5G technology capable of speeds more than 100 times faster than 4G.
华为表示，到2018年，该公司将在5G技术研发上至少投资6亿美元。5G技术的通信速度将超过4G技术100倍。
That investment is far more than has been claimed by any western rival.
这一投资规模远远超过了任何西方竞争对手声称将要投资的金额。
Indeed, this has now become a battle of regional interests to seek an edge in next-generation technology.
事实上，寻求在下一代技术中占据领先地位，已成为一种维护区域利益的争夺战。
The march towards superfast mobile internet in China has been speeded by government efforts and the desire to create a market to benefit its technology champions.
中国正大刀阔斧地建设超高速移动互联网，推动这一进程的中国政府希望借此打开一个首先惠及本国科技领军企业的市场。
China consumers will enjoy world-class network quality, with resulting benefits to the internet groups already growing rapidly in the country, though censors will probably continue keeping a close tab on content.
中国消费者将享受到世界级的网络质量，这将令该国原本已迅速成长的互联网企业受益。不过，审查部门可能会继续密切监视互联网上传播的内容。
The US is currently negotiating major trade agreements across the Atlantic and Pacific. 
美国目前正就跨大西洋和太平洋的主要贸易协议展开谈判。
Both deals are historic in scope, offering us a chance to shape the global economy in ways that strengthen US leadership in the world and the American middle class at home.
这两项协议从规模上看都是具有历史意义的，它为美国提供了一个塑造全球经济的机会，从中加强美国在全球的领导力，并壮大美国本国的中产阶级群体。
Many in Congress and in my own party view new trade agreements sceptically and are reluctant to offer their support. 
美国国会以及我所在民主党的很多人，对这些新的贸易协议持怀疑态度，不愿为其提供支持。
I understand the pressures these lawmakers face.
我对这些立法者所面临的压力表示理解。
But I am convinced that the two deals we are negotiating are in America’s best interest, and that politicians will ultimately be rewarded for making them happen. 
但我确信，我们正在磋商的这两项协议符合美国最佳利益，政治人士将最终因为协议的成功签订而获得褒奖。
That is why President Barack Obama and I are committed to seeing them through.
这就是为什么总统巴拉克•奥巴马和我致力于缔结协议的原因。
The global economy is at an inflection point. 
全球经济正处于一个拐点。
The choices we make now will determine our role in the world for decades to come. 
美国现在做出的选择，将决定未来几十年美国在全球的角色。
We have an opportunity to shape the path of global commerce to spread our values and benefit our people, and we should seize it.
我们拥有了一个影响全球商业发展的机会，以传播我们的价值观并造福于我们的人民，我们应抓住这个机会。
The US has been the world’s pre-eminent economic power for many years and will remain so for the foreseeable future. 
多年来，美国一直是全球首屈一指的经济强国，在可预见的未来仍将如此。
But the rise of new economic powers means we will face fierce competition from more places than ever before.
但新的经济强国的崛起意味着，美国将面临来自比以往任何时候都更多的地区激烈竞争。
America’s economic relations with the rest of the world matter more now than ever before. 
美国与全球其它地区的经济关系，现在比以往任何时候都更为重要。
Countries that throw up protectionist barriers and distort their economies to favour state-owned enterprises are challenging rules of the road that we have relied on for decades. 
那些匆匆设置保护主义壁垒，并扭曲本国经济、偏袒国有企业的国家，正在挑战我们几十年来一直依赖的规则。
The question is whether the US will take a leadership role in shaping a new course that reflects American values – or whether we will stand on the sidelines as a new order unfolds.
问题是，美国是将发挥领导作用、发展一条反映美国价值观的新道路，还是我们将在新秩序形成之际袖手旁观。 
The two agreements now in the works would place the US at the centre of two vast trading regions. 
目前正在磋商的这两项协议将令美国处于两个巨大贸易区的核心。
The Trans-Pacific Partnership would connect America to economies as diverse as Japan, Malaysia and Chile. 
《跨太平洋战略经济伙伴关系协定》将把美国与日本、马来西亚和智利等不同经济体连接在一起。
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership would significantly deepen what is already a multitrillion-dollar economic relationship with the EU. 
《跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系协定》将大大加深我们与欧盟(EU)已构建的数万亿美元的经济关系。
Together they would unite nearly two-thirds of the world economy in support of open and fair economic competition.
这两项协议将把全球经济的近三分之二联合在一起，支持公开和公平的经济竞争。
Both of the deals will increase US exports and help attract good middle-class jobs to America. 
这两项协议都将扩大美国出口，并帮助将优质的中产阶级工作岗位吸引到美国来。
When 95 per cent of the world’s customers live beyond our borders, exports are critical. 
全球95%的消费者生活在我们的国界以外，因此出口至关重要。
Outside studies have found that the TPP and TTIP would each increase exports by more than $120bn a year.
外部研究发现，TPP和TTIP将各令美国出口每年增加逾1200亿美元。
Some 44m Americans work for companies that export goods. 
约4400万美国人为出口商品的企业工作。
Jobs supported by exports pay as much as 18 per cent higher than the national average.
以出口为支撑的工作的薪资，比全国平均水平最多高出18%。
After decades when our economy grew but the middle class took a beating, Americans are understandably worried about rising inequality at home. 
几十年来，我们的经济尽管实现了增长，但中产阶级却遭受打击，因此，美国人现在对国内不平等程度日益加深感到担忧是可以理解的。
The president and I are determined to address this. 
总统和我决心解决这个问题。
So the deals we are negotiating are different from those our country has signed before, reflecting the lessons of two decades of globalisation. 
因此，我们正在磋商的这些协议与我们国家此前签订的协议有所不同，这反映出20年全球化所带来的教训。
They include unprecedented steps to protect labour standards, the environment and intellectual property, as well as new commitments against favouritism for state-owned enterprises. 
其中包括采取空前举措保护劳动力标准、环境和知识产权，同时做出新的承诺、反对偏袒国有企业的行为。
They require nations that might otherwise try to undercut us to match our high standards instead.
这些举措要求那些可能试图通过低价与我们竞争的国家，达到我们的高标准。
Our exports still face barriers in many countries. 
我们的出口仍面临着很多国家设置的壁垒。
These agreements must level the playing field. 
这些协议必须建立一个公平的竞争环境。

As I have said directly to Japan’s leaders, we must address barriers to American car exports if we hope to move forward.
正如我直接对日本领导人说过的那样，如果我们希望向前走，就必须消除阻碍美国汽车出口的壁垒。
But the benefits are not just economic. 
然而，这些好处不仅仅是经济上的。
As America reasserts its role as a Pacific power, many in the region are asking whether we are there to stay. 
在美国重申其作为太平洋强国的地位之际，该地区很多人在问，我们是否会继续留在那里。
Deploying soldiers and diplomats is essential. 
部署兵力和外交人员至关重要。
But as other nations use their economic might to compete for influence and even coerce smaller neighbours, there is no substitute for robust American economic engagement – on behalf of our own companies and in defence of open commerce and fair competition.
但在其他国家利用经济力量争夺影响力、甚至逼迫较小邻国之际，美国除了展开强大的经济攻势，别无选择——既要代表我们自己的企业，也要保护商业开放和公平竞争。

When a president receives support and guidance from Congress, that strengthens America’s hand at the negotiating table. 
当总统获得来自国会的支持和建议时，这将增强美国在谈判桌上的地位。
That is why the president and I have asked Congress to grant us trade promotion authority. 
这就是为何总统和我一直要求国会授权我们去促进贸易的原因。
This means that Congress outlines US objectives in detail and sets the terms for close consultation.

但我还相信，好政策将带来好政治。
And trade that strengthens America’s middle class is both.
能让美国中产阶级变强的贸易，既是好政策，也是好政治。
North Korea fires short range missiles
朝鲜再次发射两枚短程导弹
North Korea has fired two short range missiles in a second apparent show of displeasure with US-South Korean joint exercises that began last week.
朝鲜发射了两枚短程导弹，再次明确表示出对上周开始的美韩联合军演的不满。
The South Korean defence ministry said two missiles were fired from near the post city of Wonsan at 6.19am on Monday. 
韩国国防部表示，两枚导弹周一早晨6时19分自边防城市元山附近射出。
They travelled more than 500 kilometres into the ocean, but did not appear to be targeting South Korean vessels.
导弹飞行500多公里后落入海洋，但似乎并不是针对韩国船只。
This comes after North Korea performed a similar exercise on Friday, firing four short-range missiles.
上周五，朝鲜采取类似的行动，发射了四枚短程导弹。
The defence ministry also said South Korea was monitoring the situation, with no special alert footing declared.
韩国国防部还表示，韩国正在监控局势，但并未宣布进入特别警戒状态。
North Korea typically protests strongly against the annual major exercises by US and South Korean troops, which it labels preparation for an invasion.
朝鲜通常会强烈抗议美韩军队一年一度的大型联合军事演习，认为这是在为侵略做准备。
Its ambassador to London warned early last month that the joint exercises may bring the peninsula "to the brink of war", echoing bellicose rhetoric that grabbed global media attention last year.
上月初，朝鲜驻伦敦大使曾警告称，联合军演可能将朝鲜半岛“拖到战争边缘”。这与去年引起全球媒体注意的好战言论遥相呼应。
However, Pyongyang has made a series of statements over the past two months stressing its desire to improve relations with Seoul, and last month it hosted the first reunions of families divided by the inter-Korean border since 2010.
但平壤方面在过去两个月内接连发表声明，强调有意与韩国改善关系。上月，它举行了2010年以来的首次朝韩离散亲人团聚。
The South Korean ministry of defence said the joint exercises will continue as planned.
韩国国防部表示，联合军演将按计划继续进行。 
For Chinese internet finance, small is beautiful
中国互联网金融：小即是美 
Internet Finance is a term drawing massive attention from cities to villages across China. 
在中国，互联网金融成了一个引起城乡居民广泛关注的词语。
By broad definition, internet finance – which includes Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending and crowd funding – includes any organisation that extends their financial applications to the public over internet or any other IP network. 
从广义上看，互联网金融——包含个人对个人贷款（简称P2P贷款）和众筹在内——是指任何通过因特网或其他IP网络向公众提供金融服务的机构。
Heated discussion surrounds the question of whether internet finance may replace conventional banking in China, unlike in many countries where it has undergone an evolution alongside conventional banking.
在中国，围绕着传统银行是否会被互联网金融所颠覆的争论甚嚣尘上。反观其他许多国家，互联网金融与传统银行业一道经历了一场革命。
To see the future of this competition, we first need to understand the fundamental differences between them.
要看到这场竞争的未来，先得理解传统银行与互联网金融两者间的本质差异。
Here let us focus on a particular class of internet finance as an example – online lending – which includes two popular models. 
我们先集中研究一下互联网金融的一个类别——互联网贷款。互联网贷款有两种流行的模式。
One is based on e-commerce, in which loans are provided to registered customers such as with Ali finance in China and Amazon in the US. 
一种是以电商为基础，向注册客户提供的贷款，中国的代表有阿里金融(Ali finance)，美国的代表有亚马逊(Amazon)。
The other model is P2P lending, such Lufax and PP Dai in China, and Kabbage, Lending Club, Prosper Marketplace in the US and European countries.
另一种是P2P平台贷款，在中国有陆金所(Lufax)、拍拍贷(PP Dai)，欧美有Kabbage、Lending Club、Prosper Marketplace。
Almost all online lending organisations in China and overseas target small clients. 
不难看出，无论是在中国还是其他国家，互联网贷款机构的一个共同点就是以小客户为主。
The lending quotas of Ali Finance, for example, range from $8,000 to $160,000 and the minimum investment in Lufax is around $1,500. 
例如，阿里金融的贷款额度为8000美元至16万美元，陆金所的最低投资额约为1500美元。
The average loan amount of Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace, the two largest P2P platforms in US, is around $12,000 and $7,000 respectively.
作为美国两家最大的P2P贷款平台，Lending Club和Prosper Marketplace的平均贷款额分别约为1.2万美元和7000美元。
In contrast to internet finance, a lot of conventional banks prefer large customers rather than small and medium enterprises (SMEs). 
与互联网金融构成鲜明对比的是，大量的传统银行都乐于服务大客户，不喜欢中小企业。
The China Minsheng Bank, for instance, is famous for its smaller scale client business in China which has seen it lend to about 1m enterprises, but even here the average loan amount has been approximately $250,000 – significantly higher than that of online lending platforms.
例如，中国民生银行(China Minsheng Bank)以做小微客户闻名，已向约100万家小微企业发放贷款，但即使这样，其对每家客户的平均贷款额也约为25万美元，大大高于互联网贷款平台的贷款额。
The main reason for this dichotomy lies in the different risk management operations of conventional banks and internet finance companies. 
这种天壤之别的主要原因在于，传统银行与互联网金融企业的风险管理做法不同。
Conventional banks rely heavily on collateral, guarantees and offline information collection, while online platforms usually require no such collateral or guarantees while relying on online information sources. 
传统银行非常依赖抵押、担保和线下收集信息，而互联网贷款平台通常不要求此类抵押或担保，而仅靠线上信息源。
The offline information collection and collateral management functions of conventional banks are consuming of time and money; meaning that the marginal cost of such work diminishes as the size of the loan increases. 
传统银行在线下收集信息和抵押品管理方面，需要投入大量的时间和金钱；这意味着，此类工作的边际成本会随着贷款规模的增加而递减。
No wonder therefore that banks prefer granting big loans based on collateral.
也就难怪银行愿意基于抵押品发放大额贷款。
By contrast, online lending usually doesn’t require borrowers to provide collateral or guarantees. 
相比之下，互联网贷款通常不要求借款者提供抵押或担保。
But what makes online supply chain lending different is that they can obtain real-time transaction information through e-commerce platforms. 
但互联网供应链借贷的不同之处在于，可以从电商平台上获取实时交易信息。
With sufficient information input, the lending platform may trust statistical models to evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness. 
有了充足的信息输入，贷款平台可以放心地用统计模型来评估借款者的信誉可靠度。
As the borrowers are usually small ones, they are very likely to be independent of each other, and idiosyncratic risks can be diversified away, lowering the overall risk of the lending portfolio. 
由于借款者通常借款金额很小，而且他们很有可能相互独立，这样一来个别的风险被分散了，整个贷款组合的风险也就降低了。
Although statistical models do not guarantee 100 per cent accurate evaluations of borrowers, sound models can provide a stable accuracy ratio over time.
尽管统计模型不能百分百地保证对借款者评估的精确性，但长期而言，可靠的模型能实现稳定的精确度。
Nevertheless, the limited access to the credit information of individual borrowers on P2P platforms constrains risk management in P2P lending. 
然而，P2P平台对各个借款者的信用信息掌握有限，限制了P2P贷款的风险管理。
The truth is that a lot of burgeoning P2P platforms in China have no basic risk diversification, not to mention the risk management.
实际上，中国许多迅猛发展的P2P贷款平台根本没有进行基本的风险分散，更谈不上风险管理了。 
Yet predicting the future based on our current experience is very difficult, if ever possible. 
不过，要依据当前经验预测未来非常困难，甚至根本做不到。
Nevertheless, whether choosing large clients or small clients depends on the risk management procedure a lending organization adopts. 
但是，一家贷款机构服务大客户还是小客户，取决于它采用何种风险管理流程。
Based on this principal, I would imagine online lending will keep focusing on small loans. 
从这条原则出发，我猜测，未来互联网金融贷款将继续以小额贷款为主。
In particular, establishing a reliable and inexpensive credit information platform is the key to the real boom of P2P lending industry, in addition to strengthening regulation. 
尤其是，除了加强监管，建立可靠又低成本的信用信息平台，是P2P贷款行业迎来真正大发展的关键。
For banks, as interest rate liberalisation proceeds, lending to small borrowers may become a “must do”. 
对传统银行而言，随着利率自由化进程的推进，发展小额贷款可能成为“必做之事”。
In this case, banks need to find a way to lower the cost of information collection and credit evaluation procedure.
在这种情况下，传统银行需要找到办法，降低信息收集和信用评估流程的成本。

本文所表达的看法与观点仅代表作者本人，不代表中国银监会的官方政策或立场。
On being asked about his wife, Chen Dongsheng stiffens in his large ivory-coloured armchair, but stays calm. 
在被问及自己的妻子时，坐在宽大象牙色扶手椅上的陈东升突然直起身子，但仍保持着镇静。
His office manager and translator looks more weary than worried by a question about Kong Dongmei.
对于涉及孔冬梅的问题，他的办公室主任兼翻译脸上露出的似乎更多是厌倦，而不是担忧。
In China, guanxi, or connections, have always been important, but rampant corruption in recent years has in-grained a deep cynicism about al-most all such links. 
在中国，“关系”历来是个重要的东西，但近些年来，猖獗的腐败现象使得人们心中对几乎所有此类关系都产生了难以消除的深深鄙夷。
Ms Kong is a granddaughter of Mao Zedong, foun-der of the People’s Republic of China and after Mr Chen married Ms Kong in 2011, the couple began to attract innuendo-laden media coverage.
孔冬梅是新中国奠基人毛泽东的外孙女，于2011年嫁给了陈东升。此后，这对夫妇便开始引来媒体充满影射的报道。 
Ms Kong, a decade younger than 56-year-old Mr Chen, has worked at his insurance company, Taikang Life, since its earliest days. 
孔冬梅比现年56岁的陈东升小十多岁，曾供职于陈的保险公司泰康人寿，在该公司刚刚创建时便参与进来。
She also helps run a Beijing cultural centre and bookshop dedicated to communist history, and has written books about her grandfather, leading some to denigrate her for profiting from his legacy.
她还协助经营着一家位于北京的文化中心，以及一家专门介绍中共历史的书屋。她写过几本关于她外公的书，但招致了一些人的非议，说她利用她外公的遗产赚钱。
“Usually, I do not answer questions on my private life,” Mr Chen says, as we sit side by side in diplomatic formation beneath large, classical Chinese paintings. 
采访陈东升时，我们按照外交礼节相邻而坐，头顶上方悬挂着巨大的中国古典画。“一般来说，私人的事情我不回答。”陈东升说。
“[But] I can say that the connection of my wife has not much to do, or even has no relationship, with my business.”
“（但）可以这样讲，我夫人的关系和我的生意，应该讲是没有太多关系的，甚至说没有关系。”
That should be businesses. 
此处提到的“生意”可不止一个。
Mr Chen has founded three private companies in China and remains the largest shareholder of each. 
陈东升在中国创建了三个民营企业，并始终是每个企业最大的股东。
His business card shows he is chief executive and chairman of Taikang Life, China’s only national life insurer with no direct government ownership, and the country’s fourth biggest by new business sales. 
他的名片显示，他是泰康人寿董事长兼首席执行官。泰康是中国仅有的一家无政府直接投资的全国性寿险公司，也是中国以新业务销售额计的第四大寿险公司。
The card’s flipside denotes his other roles: founder and chairman of China Guardian, the world’s third biggest fine art auction house after Soth-eby’s and Christie’s; and founder of ZJS Express, a Beijing-based delivery company run by Mr Chen’s brother.
陈东升的名片背面印着他的另一些头衔：中国嘉德创始人兼董事长、以及宅急送创始人。中国嘉德是世界第三大艺术品拍卖行，仅次于苏富比(Soth-eby's)和佳士得(Christie's)。宅急送是一家总部位于北京的快递公司，目前由陈东升的哥哥经营。
He set up all three companies from scratch, starting in the early 1990s when Deng Xiaoping, then the Chinese leader, undertook his “southern tour” in 1992 to promote market ref-orms. 
这三个企业都是陈东升白手起家创办的，起始时间是上世纪90年代初。1992年，中国事实上的领导人邓小平展开“南巡”，借此来推动市场改革。
Deng wanted to stir China out of the political, social and econ-om-ic slump it entered after 1989’s pro-democracy protests were crushed.
邓当时的想法是，让中国从其在1989年天安门事件后遭遇的政治、社会和经济低谷中重新振作起来。
Mr Chen insists the three companies grew by being professional and pursuing market-oriented strategies.
陈东升坚持认为，这三个企业是靠走市场化、专业化的道路成长起来的。
The Mao name does of course still carry great prestige but the Mao family have faded from politics over many years, he says. 
他说，毛泽东的名字当然依旧有着很大的影响力，但毛家已经淡出政治很多年了。
“There is a saying that the hong-er-dai [second generation reds] is different from the guan-er-dai [second generation officials],” he says. “For sure [the former] enjoy great glory and are in the spotlight, but they don’t have much relationship with real politics and the economy.”
“最近有些议论说红二代和官二代不一样，（前者）当然有很高的荣誉荣耀、很瞩目，但是（他们）其实和现实的政治、现实的经济没有太大的关系。”
Such connections, however, mean “we have to be more cautious, as whether you do it right or wrong, you always attract jealousy and disapproval”. 
但是，这样一个背景意味着，“我们做事更要谨慎，（因为）不管你做的对或不对，都会引起很多的猜忌和不认同”。
However, he is adamant that his businesses thrive because of “corporate culture, core competitiveness, teams and brands, and not [through] government connections”.
然而，陈东升坚定地认为，他的企业的蓬勃发展是“靠企业文化、靠核心竞争能力、靠团队、靠品牌服务，而不是靠政府的关系”。 
His words are measured and Mr Chen himself is not flashy. 
陈东升说话很有分寸，也不讲究华丽的仪表和做派。
Today he is dressed plainly and his long, greying sideburns and low-rise quiff are from a different era to the shining jet-black coiffures of China’s political leaders. 
采访当天，他穿得很朴素，长长的花白鬓角和低拢的额发与中国政治领导人油光乌亮的发式相比，仿佛来自另一个时代。
Taikang’s offices are smart rather than opulent, although a baby-grand piano stands incongruously be-hind the executive floor receptionists.
泰康的办公室格调高雅，没有豪华的陈设，尽管在高管办公层的前台后方立着一架与周围环境不协调的小型三角钢琴。
Later, Mr Chen levels a more direct criticism at the guan-er-dai. 
谈到后来，陈东升对官二代提出了更为直接的批评。
“The hong-er-dai didn’t take ad-vantage and [maintained] a revolutionary quality,” he says. “The children of the recent government officials, however, made lots of money through their connection and power.”
“红二代没有索取利益，他们还保持了当年革命的本色，”他说道，“现在领导的孩子们——官二代——他们利用手中的权力、各种关系赚了很多钱。”
People who know Mr Chen personally or have dealt with his companies echo his depiction of his path to success. 
不论是陈东升的私人朋友，还是与他的企业打过交道的人士，都呼应了他对自己成功之路的描述。
Insurance executives and bankers describe him as extremely bright and hard working, and a charismatic leader of the 220,000 sales agents who deliver 60 per cent of his profits by selling life products door to door, as agents still do across much of Asia.
保险业高管和银行家们称，陈东升极其聪明和勤奋，是个富有魅力的领导者。他手下的22万名销售代理人为他创造了60%的利润，而这是通过挨家挨户推销寿险产品做到的。亚洲很多地方的销售代理人目前仍在采取这种做法。
When Mr Chen first got the business bug he left a safe job as an assistant researcher in the former Ministry of International Business and Cooperation in Beijing. 
陈东升最初迷上从商时，放弃了中国对外贸易经济合作部（这个位于北京的中央部委后来被中国商务部取代）助理研究员的“铁饭碗”。
It took four years for China to open up insurance to private capital and allow Taikang to win a licence. 
四年后，中国保险业向民间资本开放，泰康得以拿到牌照。
Since then, China Guardian has been run by co-founder Wang Yannan, while Mr Chen focused on Taikang.
从那以后，中国嘉德一直由共同创始人王雁南管理，陈东升则专注于泰康的业务。
The notion that the Chinese central bank is waging a campaign against currency speculators conjures up an image of Beijing taking on shadowy hedge funds managed by George Soros and his cohorts.
一提起中国央行近日发起的打击货币投机者的战役，就会回想起当年那场著名的“对阵”——一方是中国政府，另一方是乔治?索罗斯(George Soros)们管理的神秘对冲基金。
The reality is more prosaic and hits closer to home: much of the so-called speculation on renminbi appreciation has been longer-term investment, and many of the investors are Chinese actors, including state-owned companies, rather than global financiers.
然而，这次战役没上次那么精彩，且更多是发生在中国国内：大部分投机人民币升值的活动都是长期投资，投资者多是中国人，包括国有企业，而不是国际金融家。
By guiding the renminbi down by 1 per cent over the past week – its steepest depreciation since China introduced a new currency system in 2005 – the People’s Bank of China has rekindled uncertainty about the exchange rate.
人民币汇率在过去一周里下跌1%，这是2005年中国引入新汇率制度以来，人民币最急剧的一次贬值。通过引导这次汇率下跌，中国央行重新赋予人民币汇率不确定性。
In so doing, bankers and traders who deal with the PBoC say it wants to encourage Chinese companies to be more cautious before betting on sustained appreciation – caution which in itself could slow the renminbi’s rise.
和中国央行打交道的银行职员和交易员们表示，央行希望通过此举促使中国企业在押注人民币持续升值时更加谨慎。这种谨慎本身就可以为人民币升值降速。
In early 2012 when Beijing widened the renminbi’s daily trading band, it vowed to make the currency more volatile, as likely to fall as it is to rise. 
2012年初中国扩大人民币日交易区间时，就表示将增加人民币的灵活性，升降都有可能。
But since September of that year, it had drifted upwards without interruption, gaining 5 per cent against the dollar.
但那年9月以来，人民币却一路升值，兑美元汇率上升了5%。
“The PBoC can scream its head off about two-way [exchange rate] volatility, but for the past year and a half, the renminbi has only risen. It was a no-brainer to borrow dollars. It wasn’t speculation. It was a sure thing,” said a bank strategist in Shanghai.
上海某银行的一位策略师说：“央行尽可以大谈特谈（汇率）双向波动，但这一年半来人民币只升不降，不用脑子想都知道要借入美元。这不是投机，这是理所当然的事情。”
The main way in which Chinese companies have bet on a stronger renminbi is by borrowing dollars offshore, mainly in Hong Kong, and remitting that money into the mainland. 
中国企业押注人民币升值的主要方式是在境外（主要是香港）借入美元，然后将资金汇回中国内地。
The advantages of dollar debt are clear: the renminbi’s appreciation makes eventual repayment easier and, more importantly, offshore interest rates are much lower than Chinese rates.
持有美元债务的优势很明显：人民币升值将减轻最终偿债负担，而更重要的是，离岸市场的利率要远远低于中国境内的利率。
UBS estimates that banks in Hong Kong and Singapore have lent mainland companies around $200bn over the past 12 months alone and that $170bn of this has been sent back to the mainland. 
瑞银(UBS)估计，单是过去12个月，香港和新加坡的银行就向中国内地企业发放贷款约2000亿美元，其中1700亿美元被转回中国内地。
Chinese companies have also been highly active in offshore bond markets.
中国企业在离岸债券市场也十分活跃。
Some of that offshore borrowing went into purely speculative carry trades. 
上述离岸贷款中的一部分被用于纯粹投机的套利交易。
Investors used it to take punts on the Chinese property market or to buy high-yielding shadow-bank products.
投资者用这些钱在中国炒房，或是购买高收益的影子银行产品。
But much of it also went to the “real” economy, with property companies becoming particularly reliant on Hong Kong for financing. 
不过，随着房地产公司在融资方面变得越来越依赖香港，大部分资金还是流入了实体经济。
Offshore debt accounts for 87 per cent of the total debt of China Overseas Land and Investment, a state-owned company that is one of the mainland’s biggest real estate developers.
比如，在中国内地最大的房地产开发商之一、国有的中国海外发展有限公司，离岸债务占到了其债务总额的87%。
Safe investing practice dictates that companies borrowing in dollars to spend renminbi should hedge their currency exposure. 
企业在以美元借入而用人民币花出去时，作为安全保障，应该对它们的外汇风险敞口作对冲操作。
Normally, they would buy contracts that guarantee them dollars at an agreed-upon price in the future when they need to repay the loans. 
正常情况下，它们会买入特定合约，保证在未来偿还贷款时，按照议定的汇率支付美元。
But the relentless appreciation of the renminbi changed that calculation.
然而，人民币的连续升值改变了他们的想法。
“Because borrowers thought there was no risk, many just decided to take the dollar spot price in two years’ time,” said Zhou Hao, an analyst with ANZ. 
澳新银行(ANZ)分析师周皓（音译）表示：“由于贷款者认为不会有风险，许多人决定两年内以即期价格持有美元。”
If the PBoC could make the renminbi regain volatility, it will force people borrowing offshore to hedge their risk and that will work against renminbi appreciation.
如果中国央行能使人民币汇率再次波动起来，那将迫使离岸贷款者对冲相关风险，这将压制人民币升值势头。
The one area in which Chinese companies have hedged heavily has been in covering their exposure to dollar earnings. 
中国企业针对他们的美元收入实施大量对冲操作。
Exporters, which earn dollars but pay costs in renminbi, have been highly active in buying derivatives. 
中国的出口商赚取美元收入，却以人民币支付成本，它们在购买衍生品方面一直非常积极。
For example, Morgan Stanley estimates that $350bn of target redemption forwards – a product that pays out when the renminbi rises to a certain level – have been sold since the start of 2013.
比如，据摩根士丹利估计，自2013年初以来，一种名为“目标可赎回远期合约”的产品已销售了3500亿美元，这种产品在人民币升值到一定水平时就会产生回报。
A steeper fall in the renminbi could lead to big losses for exporters, but it would be wrong to blame speculation alone for the boom in these derivatives.
一旦人民币汇率下跌加剧，出口商就可能面临巨额亏损。不过，将此类衍生品的走俏完全归咎于投机行为也是不对的。
“Better export performance was also a key factor. It was largely hedging, though some might have over-hedged and taken a more aggressive view,” said Liu Linan, a strategist with Deutsche Bank.
德意志银行策略师刘立男表示：“出口的改善也是一个关键因素。出口商做了大量对冲，不过有的人可能更激进，对冲过度了。”
Strong demand for renminbi in Hong Kong at the start of this year also added to the complications in China.
今年初香港对人民币的旺盛需求，也使中国汇率问题变得更为复杂。
Because the renminbi was trading at a premium in Hong Kong, Chinese oil companies – the country’s biggest corporate buyers of dollars – shifted there to buy dollars, according to a currency trader with a bank in Beijing. 
北京一家银行的一位外汇交易员说，由于人民币在香港存在溢价，中国石油企业（它们是中国企业中最大的美元买家）转赴香港买入美元。
The resulting drop in dollar demand in China fuelled more appreciation pressure in the mainland market.
这导致中国境内美元需求下降，给境内人民币带来了更大升值压力。
That has gone into reverse with this week’s drop in the renminbi. 
而本周人民币下跌则逆转了这一态势。
As companies and investors in Hong Kong unwind their positions, the currency’s fall in the offshore market has been even steeper than in China, eliminating the Hong Kong premium.
在香港，企业和投资者纷纷减持人民币头寸，以致人民币在这个离岸市场的跌幅甚至超过了中国内地市场，消除了香港的人民币溢价。
“The oil companies have come back onshore to buy dollars. That is what the PBoC wanted to see,” the trader said.
这位交易员表示：“石油企业已重返在岸市场买入美元。这正是中国央行希望见到的。”
Most of the world’s internet titans are snapping up mobile apps and start-ups, from WhatsApp to AutoNavi to Viber. 
世界上大多数互联网巨头都在抢着收购移动领域的应用和初创企业，收购目标包括WhatsApp、高德(AutoNavi)和Viber。
Sina is going the opposite way. 
新浪(Sina)却反其道而行之。
It has appointed banks for a partial spinout of its Weibo platform, a Twitter-like microblog for the Chinese market. 
该公司已为分拆其新浪微博(Weibo)平台指定了银行。新浪微博是中国市场上一个类似推特(Twitter)的微博网站。
Why exit as others mob the entrance?
为什么新浪会在其他公司抢着进入市场时退出这一市场？
Sina has given no details yet. 
目前，新浪尚未就此给出任何细节。
It doesn’t need the cash. 
该公司并不缺乏现金。
It held $1.2bn in net cash as of September – equivalent to a quarter of its current market capitalisation and nearly four times its 2012 cash burn (cash flow data for 2013 are not yet available). 
截止去年9月，该公司持有的净现金为12亿美元，等于其目前市值的四分之一，接近其2012年现金消耗量的4倍（2013年的现金流数据还未公布）。
That leaves the desire for a higher valuation as the most likely motive. 
这意味着追求更高市值是最有可能的动机。
Alibaba bought an 18 per cent stake in Sina’s Weibo in April, stamping it with a value of $3.3bn. 
去年4月，阿里巴巴(Alibaba)购买了新浪微博18%的股份，这一交易对该平台的估值达到33亿美元。
But the prices of big and growing mobile communications assets have risen merrily since then. 
不过，自那时以来，大型成长型移动通信资产的价格节节攀升。
Weibo had 60m daily active users in the third quarter of last year, and Barclays reckons it has 195m monthly users. 
新浪微博去年第三季度的日常活跃用户数高达6000万，据巴克莱银行(Barclays)估计，该平台每月用户数为1.95亿。
The market values the monthly users at Facebook and Twitter at $142 and $126 apiece, respectively. 
市场对于Facebook和推特的每月用户数的估值分别是每个用户价值142美元和126美元。
Rakuten’s purchase of Viber rates its users at $90. 
日本乐天(Rakuten)收购Viber时，对其用户的估值为90美元。
Facebook just paid about $42 a subscriber for WhatsApp.
Facebook刚刚为WhatsApp的每位注册用户支付了大约42美元。
Using that last figure, Weibo would be worth $8.2bn (on what is clearly a very imprecise valuation method). 
根据以上最后一个数据，新浪微博的估值应为82亿美元（采用显然不准确的估值方法）。
Sina’s 71 per cent stake is then worth $5.8bn – against Sina’s total market capitalisation of $4.9bn. 
那么，新浪所持的71%股份应值58亿美元，而新浪的总市值才有49亿美元。
The logic of the valuations may be hard to understand. 
这种估值的逻辑也许很难理解。
The urge to chase them is not.
但急于追求这种估值的心情不难理解。
This leaves two issues outstanding. 
这就留下了两个问题。
First, what happens to the rest of Sina? 
首先，新浪其余资产怎么了？
Its other business is selling internet advertising. 
该公司另一大业务是互联网广告销售。
That is a slower-growth business, and Sina disclosures make it difficult to know how profitable it is. 
这一部分业务增长相对较为缓慢，而新浪披露的资料让人很难了解其盈利能力。
Second: where is Alibaba? 
其次：阿里巴巴会怎么做？
It has an option to increase its stake to 30 per cent. 
阿里巴巴可以选择将其持有的新浪微博股份增至30%。
If it does not do so before the float, investors may be spooked – just as their excitement about all things mobile is peaking.
如果该公司不在新浪微博分拆上市之前这么做，投资者可能会感到恐慌——恰逢他们对“移动”板块股票的兴奋见顶。
Merkel joins anti-US spying push
默克尔支持建立“欧洲版”互联网
German chancellor Angela Merkel has thrown her weight behind calls for Europe to develop internet services that are walled off from the US.
德国总理安格拉•默克尔支持有关让欧洲建立与美国隔离的互联网服务的呼吁。
Ms Merkel’s weekend comments come despite intensive efforts by President Barack Obama to quell European anger over the National Security Agency revelations made public by former contractor Edward Snowden, including documents that showed that US spy agencies had tapped Ms Merkel’s mobile phone.
默克尔是在上周末发表这番言论的。美国总统巴拉克•奥巴马此前曾做出大量努力，试图平息欧洲对于前合同工爱德华•斯诺登揭露的美国国家安全局(NSA)监听事件的愤怒，包括有文件显示，美国间谍机构曾窃听默克尔手机。
Ms Merkel said she would press French president Franois Hollande to back the push for EU-based alternatives to the current US-dominated internet infrastructure when she holds talks in Paris on Wednesday.
默克尔表示，她将在本周三在巴黎与法国总统弗朗索瓦•奥朗德会谈时，敦促奥朗德支持在欧盟(EU)建立替代网络、取代当前由美国主导的互联网基础设施的举措。
“We’ll talk with France about how we can maintain a high level of data protection,” Ms Merkel said in her weekly podcast.
默克尔在她的每周播客中表示：“我们将与法国商讨我们如何能够保持高水平的数据保护。”
“Above all, we’ll talk with European providers that offer security for our citizens, so that one shouldn’t have to send emails and other information across the Atlantic.”
“最重要的是，我们将与向我们的公民提供安全的欧洲提供商讨论，这样人们就不必跨越大西洋发送电子邮件和其他信息了。”
One US company, which refused to be named, said there were questions over the practicalities of how email between the US and countries in this undefined new service would work. 
一家拒绝具名的美国公司表示，有关美国如何与采用这种尚未界定的新式服务的国家之间传输电子邮件，尚存在疑问。
Some tech experts have warned that proposals to build alternative networks in Europe fail to take account of how the internet operates, or the continued legal obligation of American companies to turn information over to the NSA, no matter where it is stored.
一些科技专家警告称，在欧洲建立替代网络的提议没有考虑到互联网的运行方式，也没有考虑到美国企业仍有法律义务将信息移交给美国国家安全局，不管这些信息存在何处。
Ms Merkel’s decision to throw her personal backing behind EU-centric internet services reflects how politically charged the issue is in Germany.
默克尔决定亲自出面，支持以欧盟为中心的互联网服务，此举反映出这个问题在德国充满政治色彩。
Alibaba opens the door to US platform
阿里巴巴将在美国推出电商网站
Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce company that has long -connected US brands to Chinese suppliers, now wants to help sell goods to American -consumers.
长期以来为美国品牌与中国供应商牵线搭桥的中国电子商务企业阿里巴巴(Alibaba)，如今希望帮助商家将商品销售给美国消费者。
The company, which is poised for an initial public offering that analysts say could value it at more than $100bn, announced yesterday that it would launch its first majority-owned ecommerce venture in the US.
该公司昨日宣布，将在美国推出首个由其持有多数股权的电子商务网站。阿里巴巴正计划进行首次公开发行(IPO)，分析师表示，其估值可能超过1000亿美元。
Two of Alibaba’s US subsidiaries, Vendio and Auctiva, will soon launch a business-to-consumer site, called 11 Main. 
阿里巴巴在美国的两家子公司Vendio和Auctiva将很快推出一个企业对消费者网站“11 Main”。
Alibaba did not give further details about 11 Main beyond describing it as a boutique ecommerce platform selling “interesting quality products” from “handpicked shop owners”.
阿里巴巴表示，新网站将是一个精品电子商务平台，销售来自“精选店主”的“富有趣味的高质量产品”。除此之外，阿里巴巴没有透露更多有关“11 Main”的细节。
The move is the latest by Alibaba to seek additional sources of growth. 
此举是阿里巴巴寻求扩大业绩增长来源的最新举措。
Alibaba’s sites control 80 per cent of China’s ecommerce, and revenues from those sites last quarter grew by more than half to $1.78bn, but the rate of growth has slowed since last year.
阿里巴巴旗下的网站控制着中国80%的电子商务，上一季度，来自这些网站的收入增长逾一半，至17.8亿美元，但其增速自去年以来有所放缓。
Earlier this week, it made an unsolicited bid to take private AutoNavi, in an all-cash deal that values the mapping company at $1.6bn.
本周早些时候，阿里巴巴发出主动收购要约，试图将地图公司高德(AutoNavi)私有化，这一全现金收购对高德的估值为16亿美元。 
The deal would allow Alibaba to improve its mobile commerce capabilities. 
这笔交易将让阿里巴巴扩大其移动电子商务能力。
Alibaba is also expanding into wealth management services and taxi hailing apps in China.
在中国，阿里巴巴还在进军财富管理服务和打车应用。 
Alibaba now markets in the US mainly using Aliexpress, an English language website intended to connect US businesses with wholesalers in China. 
阿里巴巴现在主要利用英文网站Aliexpress在美国进行推介，该网站致力于将美国企业与中国批发商联系起来。
It operates mostly in emerging markets such as Russia, India, Chile and Brazil, but also in the US.
阿里巴巴的业务多数位于俄罗斯、印度、智利和巴西等新兴市场，但也包括美国。
A person with knowledge of the 11 Main launch cautioned against portraying it as a foray by Alibaba into the US, saying that despite having full ownership the venture wouild be run independently by its two subsidiaries.
了解“11 Main”成立过程的一位人士警告说，不宜将其描述为阿里巴巴进军美国的行动，他表示，尽管新网站由阿里巴巴全资所有，但将由其两家子公司独立运营。
Aside from a few Communist Youth League banners and a summary of the reforms unveiled at the Chinese Communist party’s third plenum last November, there is little to distinguish Dongfeng’s wholly owned Aeolus car plant from its nearby joint venture with Peugeot Citroen and Honda.
除了一些共青团标语和去年11月中共十八届三中全会出台的改革方案要点以外，东风全资拥有的风神汽车厂与附近其与标致雪铁龙和本田的合资企业看不出什么区别。
Situated in a development zone in Wuhan, an industrial city in central China, the Aeolus factory has borrowed equipment and manufacturing systems from both Peugeot and Nissan, state-owned Dongfeng’s third joint venture partner.
风神汽车厂位于华中工业城市武汉的一个开发区，该厂同时借用标致和日产(Nissan)两家公司的设备和制造系统，日产是国有企业东风汽车的第三家合资伙伴。 
The parking lots outside each plant, however, tell a different story. 
不过，每家工厂外的停车场讲述着一个不同的故事。
While thousands of cars are lined up outside Dongfeng’s Peugeot and Honda factories in Wuhan, awaiting shipment to distributors across the world’s largest car market, its Aeolus factory produces only about 300 vehicles a day, or about 100,000 units annually.
在东风位于武汉的标致和本田工厂外，数以千计的汽车等着发运至全球最大汽车市场在全国各地的经销商；相比之下，其风神工厂的日产量只有大约300辆，相当于年产量大约10万辆。
Dongfeng, one of China’s “Big Three” automobile groups alongside Shanghai Auto and First Auto Works, has more joint ventures with international car groups than any of its domestic peers. 
东风是中国“三大”汽车集团之一，另外两家分别是上汽(SAIC)和一汽(FAW)。东风与国际汽车集团建立的合资企业超过任何国内同行。
Including Korean partner Hyundai, it currently operates four joint ventures and signed a fifth partnership agreement in December with Renault. 
包括韩国合资伙伴现代汽车(Hyundai)在内，它目前经营四家合资企业，并在12月与雷诺(Renault)签署了第五份合作协议。
The Wuhan-based company is also poised to take a 14 per cent stake in Peugeot as part of a ￠3bn capital raising.
这家总部位于武汉的公司还准备购入标致14%的股份，作为后者30亿欧元募资的一部分。
Dongfeng’s four joint ventures account for more than 90 per cent of the group’s annual passenger car sales, dwarfing those of its own Aeolus brand. 
东风的四家合资企业占该集团年度轿车销量的90%以上，远远超过集团自己的风神品牌。
It is an imbalance shared by all of China’s state-owned car companies and helps explain why the country that boasts the world’s biggest car market has, unlike Japan and Korea before it, thus far failed to produce a national champion of its own that can compete globally.
中国所有的国有汽车企业都存在这种失衡，这一格局有助于解释：全球最大汽车市场为何不像之前的日本和韩国那样，涌现足以在全球舞台竞争的国家领军企业。
“On the plus side, joint ventures spin off a tremendous amount of profit for the state-owned enterprises that they’re affiliated with,” says Bill Russo of Synergistics, an industry consultancy. 
“从积极的方面讲，合资企业为它们隶属的国企带来巨大利润，”汽车业咨询公司Synergistics的罗威(Bill Russo)表示。
“On the negative side, those profits are a drug that you become dependent on. Chinese car companies haven’t really been successful at investing them into their own branded vehicles.”
“从消极的一面说，这些利润变成了一种被依赖的毒品。中国汽车企业还没有真正成功地将这些利润投资于自主品牌的汽车。”
Last month(jan), the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers announced that the country’s car sales rose more than 15 per cent last year to 18m units – almost triple the number sold in 2008. 
1月，中国汽车工业协会(CAAM)宣布，去年中国汽车销量同比增长逾15%，至1800万辆，几乎三倍于2008年销量。
During this period, the market share of Chinese brands peaked at 31 per cent in 2010 and has since fallen to 27 per cent. 
在此期间，中国品牌的市场份额在2010年达到31%的顶峰，自那以来已下降到27%。
Meanwhile, China’s 2013 car exports fell almost 10 per cent year on year to just 596,300 units – accounting for only 3.3 per cent of total production.
同时，2013年中国的汽车出口量同比下降近10%，至59.63万辆，仅占总产量的3.3%。
Imports, meanwhile, nearly tripled to 1.1m vehicles, driven by strong demand for luxury vehicles. 
与此同时，在豪华车强劲需求的推动下，中国的汽车进口几乎增加两倍，至110万辆。
While China exports more cars to Algeria than any other country – with its next biggest markets being Russia, Chile and Iran – the largest source of its own automotive imports is Germany.
中国汽车出口的头号目的地是阿尔及利亚，其次是俄罗斯、智利和伊朗，而汽车进口的最大来源是德国。
“The quality of Chinese cars currently can’t compete with multinationals,” says Yao Jie, deputy secretary-general of the association. “We need to work harder to improve domestic brands.” 
“中国汽车的质量目前还无法与跨国公司竞争，”中国汽车工业协会副秘书长姚杰表示。“我们需要加倍努力改进国内品牌。”
According to CAAM, last year China’s 10 most popular models, led by the Ford Focus, were all manufactured by Sino-foreign joint ventures.
该协会的数据显示，中国去年10大热门车型都是由中外合资企业生产的，领衔的是福特福克斯。
“Most Chinese state car companies know how to bolt a car together,” agrees Max Warburton, car analyst with Bernstein Research. 
“中国多数国有汽车企业知道如何装配汽车，”伯恩斯坦研究公司(Bernstein Research)汽车业分析师马克斯•沃伯顿(Max Warburton)表示有同感。
“But replicating a foreign manufacturing system is not a particularly valuable skill set. Real skills lie in product development and in future technology.”
“但是，复制国外的某个制造系统并不是一个特别有价值的技能组合。真正的本领在于产品开发和未来的技术。”
On a tour of Dongfeng’s Aeolus plant, employees are humble but also determined. 
在参观东风风神的工厂时可以发现，这里的员工很谦虚，也很有决心。
“I feel that we can catch up but it will take a long time, perhaps 10 years,” says Huang Mingke, a line manager who gave up a job with Dongfeng’s Peugeot joint venture even though the Aeolus plant generally pays lower wages than the joint ventures. 
“我觉得我们能赶上，但那需要很长时间，也许10年，”生产线经理黄明科（音）表示。他放弃了在东风标致合资企业的工作，即便风神厂的总体薪资水平低于合资企业。
“We are investing a lot in critical components, such as engines and transmissions.”
“我们正大举投资于关键部件，如发动机和变速箱。”
Tao Haiying, a company official, adds: “Although we have borrowed some advanced management techniques from Peugeot and Nissan, it’s only a foundation on which we are building. We can study and absorb their best practices as we create our own.” 
公司高管陶海英（音）补充说：“虽然我们从标致和日产借鉴了一些先进的管理方法，但那只是一个基础，我们正在这个基础上寻求发展。我们可以学习和吸收他们的最佳的做法，同时创建自己最好的做法。”
Many analysts believe Dongfeng and its domestic peers will have to sort out their competitive issues at home before they can emerge as a threat overseas. 
许多分析师认为，东风及其国内同行必须首先解决各自在本土市场的竞争力问题，才有望在海外展开有力竞争。
“Maybe China can do something that no one else has, but I haven’t ever seen a car company become a successful exporter without having stable development in their home market first,” says Mr Russo. 
“也许中国能够做一些从来没人能做得到的事情，但我还从未见过一家汽车公司在本国市场拥有稳定发展之前，就成为一家成功的出口商，”Synergistics的罗威表示。
“You have to achieve a certain size and scale at home before you can compete away.”
“你必须在本土市场达到一定的规模和地盘范围，才能在海外展开竞争。”
The challenge for China’s car companies will be to achieve this in the world’s most competitive automotive industry. 
中国汽车企业面临的挑战是，它们将必须在世界上竞争最激烈的汽车业实现这一目标。
When Japan and Korean automakers broke out in the 1970s and 1980s, they did so from the shelter of protected home markets.
当日本和韩国的汽车制造商在上世纪70和80年代取得突破时，正是得益于本土市场的保障。
Dongfeng’s pending deal with Peugeot and Geely’s acquisition of Sweden’s Volvo in 2010 suggest another way forward. 
东风正待完成的入股标致的交易，以及2010年吉利(Geely)收购瑞典沃尔沃(Volvo)的交易，似乎指出了另一条前进道路。
What Chinese car companies lack in experience, they can make up for in cash.
中国汽车企业缺乏经验，但他们可以用现金加以弥补。
Last year Geely established a research centre in Sweden, while Peugeot offers Dongfeng a tempting short-cut in some key areas.
去年，吉利在瑞典建立了一个研究中心，而标致在一些关键领域为东风提供了一条诱人的捷径。
On 8 March 2014, the Second Session of the Twelfth National People's Congress held a press conference at its Press Center and invited Wang Yi, China's Minister of Foreign Affairs, to answer questions from Chinese and foreign journalists about China's foreign policy and external relations.
2014年3月8日，第十二届全国人民代表大会二次会议期间，中国外交部长王毅在新闻发布会就中国外交政策和对外关系答中外记者问。

Today is the International Women's Day. 
今天也是三八妇女节。
I would like to take this opportunity to offer my best festive greetings to all the ladies in this room, including those behind the cameras.
所以我要借此机会向在场以及在镜头背后的所有女士们致以节日的祝贺。

Signs of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane point to an oil slick in the Gulf of Thailand. The 12-mile-long streak of oil could be a clue as to what happened to the Boeing 777-200 that was carrying 239 passengers early Saturday morning. Flight MH370 wound up lost after departing Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.
在泰国湾附近疑似发现了失踪的马来西亚航空的飞机，发现的是一条长达12公里的海面油迹。失踪的马来西亚航空飞机MH370航班系波音777-200飞机，载有239人，周六凌晨从吉隆坡飞往北京。
New York Times reports March 8 that Malaysia’s prime minister, Mr. Najib, said 15 aircraft and nine ships were out searching for the jet.
《纽约时报》报道说，3月8日，马来西亚总理纳吉布表示，已派出15架飞机和9艘船只参与搜救失踪飞机。
It has not been confirmed that the MH370 flight lost crashed, but fuel tanks were limited in the distance it had. 
还没有消息证实MH370航班已失事，但是这个航程的航班油量是有限的。
The possible Malaysia Airlines oil slick discovered, would benefit crash survivors if it landed in the Gulf of Thailand due to shallow waters in that area versus deep waters in the Atlantic.
现在在泰国湾附近发现了该飞机的海面油迹，也许还会有幸存者，因为泰国湾附近属于浅水区，而不是大西洋的深水区。
Suspicions of foul play showed up when authorities learned that two foreign citizens who stole passports from Asia were on flight MH370. 
但是官方发现了有两名身份不明的嫌疑人登机，因为在MH370航班上的两位外国人的护照曾经被偷。
One was an Italian and another an Austrian.
一位是意大利人，另一位是奥地利人。
The Italian man is identified as Luigi Maraldi. 
意大利人已经证实是路易吉-马拉尔迪。
An Austrian spokesperson did not identify the Austrian. 
奥地利人的身份并没有公布。
An anonymous U.S. official want to make clear that this does not mean an act ofterrorism occurred.
一位匿名的美国官方人士表示，希望这不是一起恐怖袭击事件。
“We are not ruling out anything,” said chief executive of Malaysia Airlines, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, Saturday night.“As far as we are concerned right now, it’s just a report.”
马来西亚航空首席执行官Ahmad Jauhari Yahya表示，“就目前的情况来看，我们不会排除任何可能性（指恐怖袭击的可能性），现在只是汇报情况。”
According to the report from Malaysia Airlines, passengers on the plane included "two infants, and an all-Malaysian crew of 12. The passengers included 154 citizens from China or Taiwan, 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, six Australians, five Indians, four French and three Americans, as well as two citizens each from Canada, New Zealand and Ukraine and one each from Austria, Italy, the Netherlands and Russia."
根据马来西亚航空的通报，飞机上载有“2名婴儿，12名马航的机组人员。乘客中包括154名中国或台湾人，38名马来西亚人，7名印度尼西亚人，6名澳大利亚人，5名印度人，4名法国人，3名美国人，加拿大、新西兰和乌克兰各2人，奥地利、意大利、荷兰和俄罗斯各1人。”
The mythical bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto may not be a myth after all. 
神秘的比特币之父可能根本不是一个神话。
He may in fact be a rumpled 64-year-old man named Satoshi Nakamoto who is living quietly in the San Gabriel Valley.
事实上，他可能就是个名叫中本聪、满脸皱纹的64岁男性，隐居在美国加州的圣盖博谷。
A Newsweek magazine reporter says she followed a trail that led her to a Satoshi Nakamoto in Temple City. 
美国《新闻周刊》的一名记者说她在美国加州西南部的天普市发现了中本聪的身影。
When the reporter went to Nakamoto's home unannounced, he apparently called the Temple City police, who stood watch as a short interview was conducted.
当这名记者事前没有通知就到了中本聪的家里后，他叫来了天普市的警察。警察就旁观了这次简短的采访。
"Now face to face, with two police officers as witnesses, Nakamoto's responses to my questions about bitcoin were careful but revealing," according to the Newsweek article.
《新闻周刊》上的文章写道：“在两位警察的陪同下，与中本聪先生面对面交谈时，他对我提出的关于比特币的问题回答得很小心但是也很坦诚。”
"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,' he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand. 
“我已经不再参与这个项目，所以我不能讨论它。” 中本聪先生敲打着自己的左手，对任何进一步问询都不置一词。
'It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection. "
“它已经被移交给了别人，他们正在负责这件项目。我和比特币再也没有关系了。”
It has been widely believed that Satoshi Nakamoto was a fake name for a programmer, probably much younger, who wished to be anonymous.
人们普遍认为，中本聪可能是一个年轻得多的程序员，因为希望匿名所以使用的假名。
And the Satoshi Nakamoto tracked down by Newsweek is living in a modest house. 
《新闻周刊》发现中本聪居住在一所普通的房子里。
But it's believed that the real Satoshi Nakamoto holds bitcoins worth about $400 million.
但是人们认为，真正的中本聪拥有价值4亿美元的比特币。
One thing is clear: If this is the real bitcoin inventor, his life many never be the same now that his true identity has been revealed.
有一件事情不会错：如果这是真的比特币之父，因为他的真实身份已经被曝光，他的生活将完全不同。

As relationships go, theirs is surely one of the most enduring.
就人与人之间的感情而言，下面这对父子俩的感情肯定是最恒久的一种。
Now Mr and Mrs Potato Head have had their nuptials captured on film by an inventive wedding photographer in a bid to explain his work to his young son.
一位有才的婚纱摄影师拍摄了一组土豆夫妇（出自《玩具总动员》系列的角色）的婚礼大片，他这么做是为了给小儿子解释自己的工作是什么。
Chris Thornton, 34, was left at a loss when his three-year old son Cole asked what he did for a living.
34岁的克里斯·桑顿有个3岁的可爱儿子科尔，但当儿子问起自己是做什么工作时他懵了，不知该怎样给这么小的孩子解释。
As he was a big fan of Toy Story, Mr Thornton decided to put together some shots of the characters in the traditional wedding photograph poses.
因为儿子非常喜爱《玩具总动员》，所以桑顿先生决定用电影中的角色摆出传统婚礼的造型，然后拍摄这些场景的照片。
The result will delight fans of the famous Disney Pixar films as it shows all of the characters in wedding dresses and top hats.
照片的拍摄结果会让喜欢《玩具总动员》系列的粉丝很兴奋：电影中所有的角色都身着结婚礼服、佩戴礼帽隆重出场。
Mr Thornton's mother made the outfits and her house played venue for the cartoon festivities.
桑顿先生的老母手工制作了卡通人物的礼服，同时把她的房子当做土豆人偶的婚礼背景。
She even played prop assistant by pouring a watering can to provide a back drop of rain for some sparkling backdrops.
为了营造出雨滴的晶莹背景，她甚至还在儿子拍照的时候帮忙用水罐洒水。
One of his most popular shots in the five years he's been photographing weddings features Buzz Lightyear holding the brides shoes.
在桑顿先生最受欢迎的一张照片中，巴斯光年（《玩具总动员》中的动画人物）手托新娘鞋子。
Mr Thornton, from Leeds, said: “Cole's first big love was Toy Story. It was one of the first things that he would sit and watch for longer than 15 minutes. And of course I love it too. Cole would always ask when I'm heading out of the house if I'm going to take pictures at a wedding. ”
来自英国利兹市的桑顿先生说：“科尔最爱《玩具总动员》了！这是最先能让他坐下来看15分钟以上的东西，当然了我也很喜欢看。每次我出门的时候科尔就会一直问我，我是不是要出去拍婚纱照了。”
Although he didn't really understand what this was or wasn't at all interested in any of the photos. 
虽然他实际上根本不懂婚纱摄影是什么，或者对我所拍摄的婚纱照片中的任何一张都不感兴趣。
I thought I'd try and shoot a wedding that he'd be really interested in and use my job to make him smile.
我也会努力拍一组他感兴趣的婚纱照给他看，让我的工作给他带来微笑。
“Since then he's actually got his own little camera and did take some shots at a recent wedding I was invited to.”
“自从那次以后，他有了一个自己的小相机。最近我被邀请参加一个婚礼，他还跟我去拍了几张照片。”
Cameras in the zoo's Panda House show Yuan Zai — whose name van be translated to mean "Yuan Yuan's child” or literally the "the little round thing" — slowly sliding down a hall into a common area with a mischievous smirk on her face.
在台北市动物园，摄像机记录下了熊猫房中这样一副情景：小熊猫圆仔从大厅慢慢滑到公共区域，面露调皮的表情。“圆仔”——既可以理解为熊猫圆圆的孩子，也可以理解成圆圆的小萌物。
She was crawling on her stomach as if to avoid detection.
它小心翼翼地爬着，就好像怕被发现了一样。
Yuan Yuan sees her daughter and walks over to put her back. 
圆圆发现了女儿圆仔，然后就过去把她拉了回来。

Most young adults now choose to end relationships via text, followed closely by social media.
大多数年轻人选择用发短信的方式结束一段恋情，紧随其后的是在社交媒体上分手。
Gone are the days of giving someone the courtesy of a face-to-face chat - most break-ups are now conducted digitally.
面对面谈分的的礼貌时代已经远去了——现在大部分都是用数字方式说分手的。
More than half (56 per cent) of those who went through a break-up last year ended their relationship by means of technology.
去年结束恋情的人中，超过半数（56%）的人是通过科技说分手的。
Many said they chose technology as it makes the process 'less awkward', reveals a new report.
有新的报道显示，很多人说他们之所以选择通过科技说分手，是因为这个方式”比较不会尴尬“。
The American men and women surveyed had all gone through a break up in the past 12 months, and all 2,712 respondents were aged 18-30.
接受调查的美国男性和女性去年都曾分手过，总共2712位的受访者年龄段在18—30岁。
Those taking part were asked how their last relationships had ended, and had to describe the 'means through which your break-up was finalised'.
这些调查对象要回答的问题是他们是如何结束恋爱关系的，并需要他们描述“分手过程中使用的方法”。
More than half (56 per cent) of those who went through a break-up last year ended their relationship digitally; either through text message, social media or email.
去年分过手的过半数（56%）的受访者说他们是用数字方式分手的；不是发短信，就是通过社交媒体或者发电子邮件的方式。
Two in three (62 per cent) of the respondents claimed that they had been the one to end their last relationship.
三分之二（62%）的受访者称他们是先提出分手的那一方。
The majority (55 per cent) who ended their relationship via text message explained that it made the process 'less awkward', while 61 per cent of those who dumped on social media said they did so as they had 'deleted or blocked' their last partner's phone number.
大多数（55%）的人发短信提出分手的，他们解释说是因为这让分手显得“不会太尴尬”，而61%的人说他们是在社交媒介上甩掉恋爱对象的，他们在社交媒介上“删掉或屏蔽”掉前任的电话号码。
More than half (58 per cent) of those who broke up through email claimed they had chosen that method as it allowed them to 'fully explain their reasons.'
超过半数（58%）发邮件分手的人称他们选择这种方法，是因为他们可以“完整地写出他们的理由”。
When asked if they would be annoyed if they were broken up with digitally, three quarters, 73 per cent, of those taking part said 'yes'. 
当受访者被问道如果用数字方式被甩是否会生气时，三分之四也就是73%的人的答案是“会的”。
When asked why, the majority, 60 per cent, claimed they felt it would be 'too impersonal'.
之后询问原因时，有60%的人说他们认为这样“太没有人情味了”。
According to the results, just 2 per cent of respondents claimed to have broken up using a good old fashioned written letter.
调查结果表明，只有2%的受访者称他们是用写信这样复古的方式分的手。
The study was conducted by vouchercloud.net as part of research into the part that technology plays in the lives of American consumers, given that 'technology coupons' were amongst the top searched-for on site for the past 12 months consecutively.
这项研究包括在vouchercloud.net发起的系列研究之内，它们旨在调查“科技在美国消费者生活中的影响”，研究还显示了在过去的12个月里，“电子优惠券” 居热门搜索的前几位。
'Digital has well and truly taken over, even when it comes to our relationships it seems,' says a spokesperson.
“数字产品已经完全渗透到人们的生活中，甚至介入了我们的人际关系，”发言人如是说。
'However you want to break up is entirely up to you, but it may be worth noting that we found that quite a lot of people would be hurt by a digital break-up, as it's seen as a little too impersonal.
“不过分手这件事只有你自己才能决定，但是我们发现很多人因为数字方式的分手而伤透了心，这个发现值得重视，因为这样的分手方式有点不近人情。”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been nominated for the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize; but the conflict in Ukraine is also likely to be on the Nobel committee's agenda.
俄罗斯总统普京获2014年诺贝尔和平奖提名，但乌克兰冲突也很可能位列诺贝尔和平委员会议程。

This year’s gathering of China’s official lawmaking and top political advisory bodies, which will rubber-stamp laws and policies decided by the ruling Communist party, will be closely watched as it is the first to be held since President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang formally took the reins of government, writes Jamil Anderlini in Beijing.
中国官方立法机构和最高政治咨询机构今年的全体会议（简称“两会”）将备受关注，因为这是中国国家主席习近平和总理李克强正式执政以来首次举行的两会。两会将形式化地批准执政的共产党已经决定的法律和政策。
Each year there is talk about whether or not these gatherings of China’s National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Congress remain just a political pageant, or if the party is allowing more debate to creep in. 
人们每年都会谈论，“全国人民代表大会会议”和“中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会会议”是否仍只是一场政治表演，抑或党会允许更多的辩论？
The main topics at this week’s event are likely to include:
本周召开的两会可能涉及以下主要议题：
Growth targets
经济增长目标 
These are expected to remain unchanged, but if they are it could provide useful insight into the new leaders’ thinking on the strength of the economy and how willing they are to accept lower rates of growth as they try to reform the economic model.
这些目标预计不会有变化。但如果有变，它将帮助我们理解新领导人对于中国经济强劲程度的思路，以及他们在试图改革经济发展模式时，在多大程度上愿意接受更低的增长率。
Real estate policy
房地产政策
After years of ineffectual attempts to rein in the booming property market, there are some signs the leadership is preparing policies to bring down residential prices, a source of discontent among the growing urban population. 
房价是中国不断扩大的城市人口的一个不满来源。在多年控制房价飙升的努力失败后，有迹象表明领导层正准备出台降低住房价格的政策。
The annual government report is often used to announce such policies.
每年一度的政府工作报告往往用于公布这类政策。
Other areas
其他领域
Reform of state-owned enterprises, pollution, foreign relations, local government debt and shadow banking.
包括国有企业、环境污染、外交关系、地方政府债务，以及影子银行业的改革。
Washington’s outgoing ambassador to Beijing has ended his three-year posting on a combative note, saying Chinese travellers’ experience of freedoms and democracy during trips to the US could encourage them to “want some of those same things”.
即将离任的美国驻华大使骆家辉在结束三年任期之际发表了不太客气的言论，称中国游客在访美期间体验的自由和民主可能会鼓励他们“向往一些同样的东西”。
Gary Locke is leaving Beijing at a time of heightened Sino-US tension over issues ranging from President Barack Obama’s recent meeting with the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s spiritual leader, to Beijing’s declaration of an air defence identification zone over the East China Sea last year.
骆家辉离开北京之际，中美关系的紧张程度有所加剧，问题包括美国总统巴拉克?奥巴马(Dalai Lama)最近会晤西藏精神领袖达赖喇嘛，以及北京方面去年宣布在东中国海划设防空识别区。
Since his appointment in 2011, Mr Locke has been at the centre of a series of diplomatic spats between China and the US, one of which led to Beijing’s highest-level political purge since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
自2011年获得任命以来，骆家辉一直置身于中美之间一系列外交口水战的中心，其中一场交锋后来导致中国高层出现自1989年天安门事件以来最高级别的政治整肃。
In a wide-ranging farewell briefing on Wednesday, Mr Locke emphasised the importance of streamlining visa applications for Chinese tourists and business people. 
在周三发表的涵盖内容广泛的告别演讲中，骆家辉强调了对中国游客和商务人士简化签证申请程序的重要性。
“Part of the reason for doing that is to enable more Chinese to experience America, to see first-hand our freedoms, our democracy, our diversity,” he said. 
“这么做的部分原因是……让更多的中国人体验美国，亲眼目睹我们的自由、我们的民主、我们的多样性。”他表示。
“I hope that perhaps from their experiences in the US they’ll want some of those same things in China or understand what is possible in China.”
“我希望，也许在美国的经历会鼓励他们在中国向往一些同样的东西，或者了解中国可能达到什么样的境界。”
As Washington’s first Chinese-American ambassador to Beijing, Mr Locke has been a popular figure in China even while clashing with Chinese government officials on a number of fronts. 
作为首位华裔美国驻华大使，骆家辉在中国一直人气较高，尽管他在许多方面与中国政府官员发生冲突。
He will be succeeded by Max Baucus, a former Montana senator.
接任他的将是蒙大拿州前参议员马克斯?鲍卡斯(Max Baucus)。 
In a reference to the recent war of words between Beijing and Tokyo over a group of islands administered by Japan, Mr Locke warned both sides of “an unintended incident that leads to unintended consequences” and also spoke of the need for “more direct and instantaneous” communication between the US and Chinese militaries.
在提及近期中日两国围绕一个由日本管辖的岛群的争端时，骆家辉警告双方提防“某个无意中的事件导致意想不到的后果”，他还谈到美中两军之间需要建立“更为直接和即刻”的通信联络渠道。
The People’s Liberation Army and the Pentagon established a “defence telephone link” after a Chinese jet collided with a US surveillance aircraft over the South China Sea in 2001. 
2001年一架中国战斗机在南中国海与一架美国侦察机发生碰撞后，中国人民解放军与美国五角大楼建立了“国防电话联系”（简称DTL）。
But the DTL does not function as a direct hotline, as military-to-military discussions over it must be scheduled in advance. 
但DTL在功能上并不是直通的热线，因为两军通过它进行的讨论必须提前预定。
“You need to make sure there are the right people available monitoring these attempts to communicate, whether it’s picking up the phone or receiving the email or the secure cables,” Mr Locke said. 
“你需要确保有合适的人员值班，随时监控此类联络尝试——无论是拿起电话，还是接收电子邮件或安全电报。”骆家辉表示。
“You can have all the mechanisms in the world, but if no one’s there to act upon it then it doesn’t make much sense.”
“你可以拥有世界上所有的机制，但如果没有人在岗位上值守、采取行动，那就没有多大意义。”
Mr Locke was unapologetic about his engagement with Tibetans and Uighurs – ethnic groups whose home regions in China are increasingly restive – as well as religious leaders and legal activists, saying US diplomats were eager to “learn about what they were doing and see how we could support them”.
骆家辉对于他与中国藏族和维吾尔族（在中国，这些民族的聚居地越来越不安定）人士、以及宗教领袖和法律维权人士接触毫无歉意，称美国外交官渴望“了解他们在做什么，看看我们如何能够支持他们”。
“Human rights is about more than just economic prosperity,” Mr Locke said. “It is also about fundamental and universal rights, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly... We call on China to improve its record.”
“人权的内涵不仅仅是经济繁荣，”骆家辉表示，“它也涉及基本和普遍的权利、言论自由、集会自由……我们呼吁中国改善其记录。”
The ambassador referred to the failed asylum request in 2012 of Wang Lijun, a former Chinese police chief, as a “very, very intense 48-hour period”. 
这位即将离任的大使称，2012年重庆市前公安局长王立军申请庇护未获准的事件是“非常、非常紧张的48小时”。
Mr Wang’s flight to a US consulate led to the purge and prosecution of Bo Xilai, the then party head of Chongqing, China’s most populous city.
王先生逃亡美国领事馆最终导致时任重庆市委书记的薄熙来遭整肃并被提起公诉。
In guiding the renminbi into its steepest dive since 2005 this week, Beijing was employing a strategy of “one arrow, two vultures”, as the saying goes.
中国政府本周引导人民币汇率创下自2005年以来的最大跌幅。用中国话说，这一策略可谓“一箭双雕”。
The first vulture denotes the international speculators who have – in spite of warnings by Chinese officials – regarded renminbi appreciation against the US dollar as a one-way bet. 
第一个打击目标是海外投机者，他们一直无视中国官员的警告，押注于人民币对美元的单边持续升值。
The second vulture signifies the domestic shadow financiers who refuse to be brought down to earth.
第二个打击目标，是中国国内不受约束的影子金融玩家们。 
Neither of Beijing’s avian quarries is dead or even mortally wounded, but the renminbi’s surprise decline will have ruffled plenty of feathers. 
这两只鸟都没有被打死，甚至没有受到致命伤害，但人民币的意外贬值肯定大大惊动了它们。
More importantly, it serves notice that China is opening up a new front in its battle to reduce risks in a highly volatile financial system.
更重要的是，中国政府此举表明，它正开辟一条新的战线，来帮助自己应对动荡金融市场中的高风险。 
It takes a little detective work to unravel how guiding the renminbi lower helps China manage financial risks because it involves a vast twilight zone of financial dealings for which there is little data, official or otherwise. 
要搞明白引导人民币汇率下跌如何能帮助中国控制金融风险，我们需要做一点“侦探”工作，因为这个问题涉及到一大片不透明的金融交易，官方或非官方数据在这里几乎不存在。
Nevertheless, it is the dealings in this zone – which includes domestic shadow finance and irregular cross-border capital flows – that are increasingly setting the tone for Beijing’s policies.
不过，正是这一领域中的各种交易——包括境内的影子金融以及非正规的跨境资本流动——正日益决定着中国政府的政策基调。
The story starts with the People’s Bank of China’s repeated failure to bring shadow finance to heel. 
故事的源头，在于中国央行(PBoC)规范影子金融的努力屡告失败。
Since the announcement of Document 463 in December 2012, authorities have been turning up the pressure on shadow finance, mainly with the aim of preventing high-interest trust loans from triggering defaults among local government borrowers. 
自2012年发布463号文以来，中国监管部门一直在加大对影子金融的施压力度，主要目标是防止高息信托贷款引发地方政府借款者违约。
But official statistics show that such efforts have not yet borne fruit. 
但官方统计数据显示，这一努力仍未取得成效。
Entrusted loans rose to Rmb396.5bn ($64.7bn) in January, almost double the levels of the same month a year ago.
信托贷款规模今年1月增至3965亿元人民币（合647亿美元），几乎是上年同期的两倍。
Worse than this failure, though, is evidence that the PBoC’s policies may be backfiring. 
更糟的是，有证据显示，中国央行的政策可能起到了反作用。
Dodging the central bank’s pressure to liquidate shadow financial assets (which offer attractive returns), banks are opting instead to sell off lower yielding enterprise bonds (debt issued by state-owned companies), thus raising the cost of financing to companies and local governments, according to research by China Confidential, a research service at the Financial Times.
英国《金融时报》旗下研究机构《中国投资参考》的研究显示，面对央行要求清算影子银行资产（此类资产收益率诱人）的压力，各银行转而选择出售收益率较低的公司债券（多由国企发行），因此增加了企业和地方政府的融资成本。
While this squeezes the supply of credit to the “real” economy, the shadow finance segment is nourished by inflows of capital that gush through a hundred holes in China’s nominally “closed” capital account.
这种做法挤压了实体经济的信贷供应，而与此同时，中国名义上封闭的资本账户其实存在无数漏洞，境外资本能够透过这些漏洞源源不断流入中国，滋养影子金融部门的蓬勃发展。
A shadow banker in Ningbo, eastern China, recently described the attractions of such a trade. 
最近，在华东城市宁波，一名影子银行玩家描述了这类交易的吸引力。
“It is easy to borrow abroad at around 1 per cent annual interest. Then change that money into renminbi and bring it into the mainland,” said the banker, who declined to be identified because of the illegal nature of his business.
他说：“在国外，很容易以1%的年利率借到钱。然后将借到的钱兑换成人民币，将其带入境内。”他拒绝透露自己的身份，因为他从事的业务是违法的。
“You can get around 10 to 12 per cent by lending it to a trust or around 20 per cent by putting it with an underground bank. On top of that you get whatever the renminbi has appreciated by the time you need to repay the foreign loan.”
“借给信托公司能拿到10%到12%的利息，借给地下钱庄能拿到20%左右。除此之外，到了偿还海外贷款的时候，你还能拿到人民币在此期间的升值收益。”
One sign that this cross-border carry trade has been robust of late is evidence of an increase in the over-invoicing of exports, a common ruse used to spirit funds into the mainland. 
这种跨境“套息交易”近来非常活跃的一个迹象就是，虚开出口发票现象有所增加。虚开出口发票是将境外资金秘密带入境内的常用招数。
A China Confidential survey of exporters in January found that 44 per cent of respondents thought that such fake invoicing was on the increase.
《中国投资参考》1月对出口商的一项调查发现，44%的受访者认为，虚开发票现象近来在增加。
Besieged by these pressures, it is hardly surprising that the PBoC was keen to shoot an arrow. 
面临这些压力，中国央行急于“投石打鸟”就容易理解了。
Its hope is that by instilling in speculators’ consciousness a sense that the renminbi can fall as well as rise, it will staunch the inrush of speculative capital lured by the outsized returns available in the mainland’s shadow finance markets.
它的期望是，通过迫使投机者意识到人民币可以涨也可以跌，抑制投机资本的流入，而这种资本目前主要是受到中国境内影子金融市场超高回报率的吸引。
In this, as ever, Beijing is looking for incremental shifts, such as the 1.2 per cent that the renminbi has depreciated by so far this year. 
这一次，中国政府依然采取了惯用的渐进式手法，比如今年迄今人民币累计跌幅仅1.2%。
It knows that if it were to try to stop the inflow of illegal capital entirely, it may trigger the very wave of financial defaults it is hoping to avoid. 
中国政府清楚，如果它试图将非法资本完全挡在门外，可能恰恰会引发它原本希望避免的一波金融违约。
Thus a gradual approach using exchange rate flexibility to generate a market response seems to suit the PBoC’s objectives for now.
因此，就目前而言，这种渐进手法——利用利率弹性波动来制造市场反应——看上去符合中国央行的目标。
One of China’s best known ethnic rights activists has been charged with “separatism” in the restive far western region of Xinjiang, in the latest sign of a tightening by the authorities in a region that is expected to receive a surge in industrial investment.
中国最知名的少数民族维权人士之一伊力哈木•土赫提已被控在西部省份新疆从事“分裂活动”。这是中国政府加强对这一不稳定地区控制力度的最新迹象。与此同时，这一地区预计将迎来大规模的工业投资。
Ilham Tohti, an economist and the most prominent voice for Uighurs in China, has not been seen since security forces detained him with some of his students in Beijing in January. 
经济学家土赫提是中国最著名的维吾尔族维权人士。今年1月，他和他的一些学生在北京被警方扣留，他本人此后再也没有现身。
His lawyer, Li Fangping, told the Financial Times on Wednesday that authorities in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, are refusing to meet him or allow him to see his client.
他的律师李方平周三对英国《金融时报》表示，新疆首府乌鲁木齐当局目前拒绝与他见面，也不允许他见自己的当事人。
Xinjiang has been the scene of several violent clashes between security forces and local Uighur groups demanding more autonomy in recent years.
近年来，新疆警方和当地要求获得更多自治权的维吾尔族群体发生了多起暴力冲突。
Mr Tohti’s detention came shortly before a Beijing court sentenced another progressive activist, Xu Zhiyong, to four years in prison for organising a movement that urged Communist party leaders to reveal their personal wealth. 
土赫提被扣押后不久，北京一家法院判处另一位维权人士许志永四年有期徒刑，原因是他组织了一场敦促共产党领导人公开个人财产的运动。
Across the nation, dozens of less well-known ethnic rights activists, environmental campaigners, human rights activists and outspoken internet personalities have also been detained or jailed in the past year.
去年，中国各地还有数十名相对不太知名的少数民族维权人士、环保运动发起者、人权活动人士和言论大胆的网络“大V”被扣留或监禁。
The Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim people, make up about half the population of Xinjiang – an oil-rich, arid region on the Chinese border with central Asia. 
维吾尔族在语言上隶属土耳其语系，信仰伊斯兰教，约占新疆总人口的一半。新疆是中国与中亚接壤的地区，气候干旱，石油资源丰富。
Chinese security forces have reported several clashes with Uighurs in recent months, including two in Aksu prefecture in the past two months in which 20 “attackers” were shot by police or died in explosions.
近几个月，中国警方已报告了多起与维吾尔族人的冲突事件，包括前两个月在阿克苏地区发生的两起冲突，其中有20名“袭击者”被警方击毙，或在爆炸中丧生。
Tohti and his Mandarin-language website Uighurbiz.net was one of the only channels within China willing to cite specific local grievances, economic inequality or instigation by authorities as the cause of clashes in Xinjiang. 
土赫提和他创办的汉语网站“维吾尔在线”在解释新疆冲突事件时，列举了当地人的一些具体诉求、经济不平等和当局煽动民众情绪等原因，是中国极少数敢于这样表态的信息渠道之一。
The Chinese government nearly always attributes unrest in the region to terrorism.
中国政府几乎总是将新疆的局势不稳定归咎于恐怖主义。
Security forces have maintained a heavy presence in Xinjiang, particularly in the Uighur heartland around Kashgar, since Uighur rioters killed about 200 people, mostly ethnic Han Chinese, in Urumqi in July 2009. 
2009年7月，乌鲁木齐的维吾尔族暴徒杀死约200人，其中大部分是汉族人，自那以来，新疆地区一直部署着大量警力，尤其是在维吾尔族心脏地区喀什的周边。
A writer for Uighurbiz.net was jailed for 15 years for endangering state security after speaking to foreign journalists after the riot and posting critical articles online.
暴乱后，“维吾尔在线”的一名作者接受了外国记者采访，并在网上发布了批评文章。此后，他因危害国家安全罪被判入狱15年。
The crackdown on outspoken dissidents comes as Chinese state-owned companies prepare for huge mining and coal conversion projects in Xinjiang, which holds about 40 per cent of the nation’s coal reserves. 
就在政府打压敢于直言的异见人士之际，中国国有企业正准备在新疆开展大规模采矿和煤转化项目。
Most of those deposits were untapped until recently, but a decade-long central government push to “Develop the West” combined with more recent policies to reduce coal use in the more prosperous coastal cities has spurred investment in remote Xinjiang and across the arid north and west.
新疆拥有中国约四成的煤炭储量，许多矿藏直到最近才被开发。不过，中央政府十年来推行的“西部大开发”和最近减少沿海发达城市煤炭使用的政策，刺激了对偏远的新疆地区以及中国整个北部和西部干旱地区的投资。
Xinjiang already accounts for almost one-third of Chinese domestic oil production and about 60 per cent of its cotton harvest.
新疆的石油产量已占中国国内石油总产量的近三分之一，棉花产量占全国六成左右。
Narendra Modi, the Indian opposition leader, has told China to abandon its “expansionist attitude” in a rare foray into foreign policy as his general election campaign gathers pace.
印度反对党领袖纳伦德拉•莫迪告诉中国应抛弃“扩张主义态度”。随着莫迪加紧展开竞选活动，他在外交政策方面突然发力。
Mr Modi, prime ministerial candidate for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, was portraying himself as an Indian patriot in a weekend speech in the Himalayan border state of Arunachal Pradesh – a territory claimed in its entirety by neighbouring China.
上周末，印度教民族主义的印度人民党的总理候选人莫迪在喜马拉雅山麓的边境邦阿鲁纳恰尔邦发表讲话，将自己描绘为一个印度爱国者。邻国中国声称整个阿鲁纳恰尔邦（中国称为藏南——译者注）是中国领土。
“No power on earth can take away even an inch from India,” he told a rally in Pasighat in the far northeast of India. “China should give up its expansionist attitude and adopt a development mindset.” 
莫迪在印度东北边陲巴昔卡(Pasighat)的一个集会上表示：“任何强权都无法从印度夺走哪怕一寸土地。中国应放弃扩张主义态度，转而采取一种发展的心态。”
He wore a traditional hat from the local Adi tribe decorated with a hornbill’s giant beak.
他头戴一顶当地阿迪人的传统样式帽子，上面装饰有一个巨大的犀鸟嘴。
Mr Modi, who has focused until now on his plans to restore economic growth and boost investment and jobs in India, said: “I swear by this land that I will not let this nation be destroyed, I will not let this nation be divided, I will not let this nation bow down.”
此前一直专注于重振印度经济增长、提振投资和就业方面计划的莫迪，在讲话中表示：“我对这片土地发誓，我不会允许这个国家被毁掉，我不会允许这个国家被分裂，我不会允许这个国家低头屈服。”
India’s governing Congress party has in the past been equally insistent on rejecting China’s claims over Arunachal Pradesh, but Mr Modi is eager to burnish his nationalist credentials in the run-up to the election to be held within three months.
印度执政党国大党过去同样坚决拒绝中国对阿鲁纳恰尔邦的主权声明，但在大选日期距今不到3个月之际，莫迪急于打磨自己在民族主义方面的信誉。
Sanjaya Baru, director for geoeconomics and strategy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a global security think-tank, likened Mr Modi to Shinzo Abe, the nationalist Japanese prime minister whose goals include economic revival as well as pushing his country to stand up to an increasingly assertive China.
全球安全事务智库——国际战略研究所的地缘经济与战略主管散嘉亚•巴鲁将莫迪与日本的民族主义首相安倍晋三相提并论，后者的目标既包括经济复兴，也包括推动日本在日益强势的中国面前站起来。
“Modi would project himself as a more nationalistic leader, just in the way that Abe does,” said Mr Baru, adding that Indian foreign policy under a Modi government would probably not be fundamentally different to that of Manmohan Singh, the current Congress prime minister.
巴鲁表示：“莫迪会将自己塑造为一个更加民族主义的领袖，正如安倍所做的那样。”他补充表示，莫迪政府的印度外交政策或许不会与现任国大党总理曼莫汉•辛格有何本质区别。
Chinese look to retail agents for a taste of luxury
中国兴起奢侈品代购热 
May Liu earns about $2,500 a month as an office worker in Hong Kong, but she spends about 10 to 15 times that on luxury goods, buying everything from Prada handbags to products from US cosmetic brand Fresh.
May Liu是一名在香港工作的办公室文员，每月收入约2500美元，但她在奢侈品上的花费是这一金额的10至15倍，购买的产品从普拉达(Prada)的手袋到美国馥蕾诗(Fresh)的化妆品无所不包。
While Ms Liu loves shopping, she buys mostly for others in her role as a “daigou” agent – a growing breed of people who specialise in helping mainland Chinese consumers secure products from overseas.
虽然May Liu喜欢购物，但她主要是作为一名“代购”帮别人买东西——作为一个人数日渐增长的群体，代购专门帮助中国内地顾客从境外购买商品。
She started her daigou business a year ago as a way to earn more money, but the young mainland Chinese was soon bringing in up to $10,000 a month. 
她一年前开始从事代购业务，以增加收入，但不久之后，这位来自中国内地的年轻人每月最高就可进账一万美元。
Ms Liu now has about 2,600 clients, who use Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, and WeChat, a messaging app, to order goods.
May Liu现在约有2600名客户，这些客户通过微博（Weibo，相当于中国的推特(Twitter)）以及聊天应用微信(WeChat)来下单订购商品。
“I didn’t know how much money I would make. I didn’t have any expectation of profits,” says Ms Liu, who asked to use a pseudonym. “I only knew it would be profitable.”
May Liu要求使用化名。她说：“我不知道自己能赚到多少钱。我对利润没有任何预期。我只知道这一行能赚钱。”
She has not given up her day job, realising that being a daigou agent, while highly profitable, can also be illegal.
她没有辞去正职工作，因为她明白，代购这一行虽然利润丰厚，但可能是违法违规的。
Some agents focus on ferrying goods from Hong Kong to mainland China.
一些代购专门从事将商品从香港代送到中国内地的业务。
But the web-based phenomenon has spread to expatriate Chinese who are help compatriots back home buy brands from cities such as Paris, London, New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul.
但这一兴起于网络的现象现已扩散到了旅居海外的中国侨胞群体，他们帮助国内同胞从巴黎、伦敦、纽约、香港、东京以及首尔等城市购买名牌商品。
The daigou boom is an example of how ecommerce is rapidly transforming the Chinese retail market.
代购热潮是一个明证，表明电子商务正在快速改变中国零售市场的面貌。
According to Chinese media, there are hundreds of thousands of people working in the daigou business. 
据中国媒体报道，目前有好几十万人在从事代购业务。
A search for the term on Alibaba’s Taobao, China’s largest online marketplace, produces more than 240,000 virtual stores and nearly 15m items from child car seats through air purifiers to pocket printers.
在阿里巴巴(Alibaba)旗下网站淘宝上搜索“代购”一词，会显示出超过24万个网络店铺以及近1500万种商品，从儿童汽车座椅、空气净化器到便携式打印机无所不包。淘宝是中国最大的在线交易平台。 
The China e-Commerce Research Centre says the daigou market grew 19-fold between 2008 and 2012 when it reached Rmb48bn, and reckons that it rose again in 2013 to Rmb74bn ($12bn). 
中国电子商务研究中心表示，代购市场在2008至2012年间增长了19倍，规模达到了人民币480亿元，2013年代购市场继续增长，规模达到了人民币740亿元（合120亿美元）。
According to a recent study by Bain, about 60 per cent of the Chinese consumers who buy luxury goods have used daigou at some point.
贝恩公司(Bain & Company)近期进行的一项研究显示，约有60%的中国奢侈品消费者曾经使用过代购服务。
The business is thriving for several reasons. 
代购行业蓬勃发展主要是由于以下几个原因。
Many Chinese believe the same product is better made when bought overseas because of the mainland’s uneven reputation for quality.
很多中国人认为，同一种产品，购自海外的质量会好一点，因为中国大陆的产品有着质量不稳定的名声。
The rising strength of the renminbi, the growing purchasing power of Chinese consumers, and high-profile food safety scandals in China, have also spurred demand for safe and high-quality foreign products.
人民币汇率稳步走强，中国消费者的购买力不断提升，中国食品安全丑闻引起公众关注，也都刺激了市场对安全性高、质量又好的外国产品的需求。
Mo Daiqing, an analyst at the e-commerce research centre, says the main reason Chinese are turning to daigou is because of hefty import tariffs on luxury goods. 
中国电子商务研究中心的分析师莫岱青表示，中国消费者转向代购的主要原因是，国内对奢侈品的进口关税太高。
China levies a 50 per cent duty on cosmetics, one of the dominant daigou categories, and that is before the imposition of the standard 17 per cent value added tax that is added to imported luxury products.
目前中国对化妆品征收50%的关税（这是代购商品中的一大主要门类），而在此之后还要再对进口奢侈品按标准征收17%的增值税。 
“The same brands of milk powder, cosmetics and handbags are much cheaper in Hong Kong, the US, Japan and South Korea than in mainland China,” said Ms Mo.
莫岱青表示：“同样品牌的奶粉、化妆品以及手袋，在香港、美国以及韩国买的要比在中国大陆便宜很多。”
But the industry is increasingly drawing attention from customs officials in mainland China and Hong Kong, particularly with the rising numbers of so-called parallel traders who take advantage of multi-entry visas to cross the border at the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen many times a day, carrying products for resale that they do not declare at customs.
但代购行业正日益受到中国内地和香港海关官员的关注，特别是人数越来越多的“水客”。这类人利用一签多行政策，在中国南方城市深圳每日穿越边境多次，将所携带的未报关商品在境内转手出售。
Dong Yizhi, a lawyer who specialises in ecommerce, points out that the daigou business is not illegal if the agents pay import taxes, but says that if agents pay duties the premise of the business becomes moot.
专长电商领域的律师董毅智指出，如果代购人员支付进口关税，那么代购业务就不是违法的；但在这种情况下，代购将失去存在的意义。
“If they pay customs duties, the price disparities will be much smaller and they won’t make money,” said Mr Dong.
董毅智表示：“如果代购支付关税，国内外商品的差价将显著缩窄，代购就赚不了什么钱。”
Chinese citizens can legally import Rmb5,000 ($823) of duty-free goods for personal use each time they return to the mainland. 
中国公民从境外返回中国大陆时，每次可以依法携带价值不超过人民币5000元（合823美元）的免税商品供个人使用。
But Shenzhen customs officers are taking a tougher line on parallel traders who cross the border back into the mainland more than once a day with goods over the value of Rmb500.
但深圳海关对每天往返境内超过一次的水客采取了更加严厉的标准：每次携带的免税货品价值不得超过人民币500元。
Liu Lizhen, a Shenzhen customs official, said the move was aimed at clamping down on the abuse of the multiple re-entry system.
深圳海关官员刘丽珍（音译）表示，此举旨在打击滥用多次往返签证机制的情况。
This has become a more serious issue in Hong Kong since 2009 when it started allowing Shenzhen permanent residents to enter the former British colony without restrictions.
自2009年以来，水客在香港已经成了一个愈发严重的问题。香港自2009年开始允许深圳市永久居民不限次数前往这片曾经的英属殖民地。
“We once found a person who had crossed the border 26 times a day,” said Ms Liu.
刘丽珍称：“我们曾经发现过一个人，他在一天之内穿越边境26次。”
According to the Shenzhen customs bureau, more than 20,000 parallel traders operate at the six land border checkpoints between Hong Kong and the southern Chinese city.
来自深圳海关的信息显示，在香港与深圳之间的6个陆路口岸往返的水客数量超过了两万人。
Hong Kong’s immigration department said just over a thousand parallel traders were arrested last year for breaching the terms of their stay in the territory.
香港入境事务处表示，去年超过1000名水客因为违反在香港境内的逗留条款而被逮捕。
Despite the crackdown, May Liu, the daigou agent, says she is not worried, and still travels to Shenzhen a few times a week.
虽然面临政府打压，但作为一名代购的May Liu表示自己并不担心，仍然每周数次前往深圳。
“Carrying so much stuff across the border every time provides me with a lot of exercise. I don’t even have to go to the gym,” jokes Ms Liu.
她开玩笑称：“每次带这么多东西穿越边境对我来说是强度很大的锻炼。我甚至都不用去健身房了。”
‘Brands are much cheaper in Hong Kong, the US, Japan and South Korea than China’
“名牌商品在香港、美国、日本以及韩国的售价远比在中国内地便宜。”
China closes net around former security chief
中国将两名高级别官员列为调查对象 
China has placed two high-ranking officials under investigation in moves that appear to close the net more tightly around the country’s powerful former security chief.
中国已将两名高级别官员列为调查对象，此举看上去是在对权势甚大的中共中央前政法委书记周永康加紧收网。
The detentions are the latest in a series that have targeted former colleagues of Zhou Yongkang, who ran China’s domestic security apparatus until 2012. 
周永康担任中共中央政法委书记至2012年。此前一系列成为打击对象的官员都曾是周永康的同事，上述案件是其中最新的两起。
The Communist party is widely believed to have already placed Mr Zhou under virtual house arrest but it has yet to announce any legal action against him.
人们普遍认为，中共已将周永康软禁在家中，但至今未宣布对他的任何法律行动。
As a member of the nine-person politburo standing committee that ruled China, Mr Zhou, 71, is the most senior politician to be caught up in a corruption investigation in decades.
现年71岁的周永康曾是中共中央政治局9名常委之一，是几十年来被卷入反腐调查的最高级别政治人物。
In a sign that the party could be tightening its grip around him, two more former allies have been detained, adding to a growing list already under investigation, according to reports.
多家媒体报道，又有两名周永康的前盟友被拘留，凸显出党可能在对周收网。目前有越来越多的周永康前盟友在接受调查。
Shen Dingcheng, Communist party secretary of PetroChina International, the state oil company, was detained before the Chinese New Year last month, according to China Business Journal newspaper. 
据《中国经营报》报道，中石油国际党委书记沈定成已在春节前被拘留。
Mr Shen had served as secretary to “a particular leader at China National Petroleum Corporation at some point between 1992 and 1997”, the newspaper reported.
该报称，沈定成“在1992年至1997年间担任中石油天然气总公司办公厅副处级秘书”。
It did not mention Mr Zhou by name but he was a top leader of CNPC during those years, building up a group of supporters that later came to be known as the country’s “petroleum faction”. 
该报道未提及周永康的名字，但他在那段时间先后担任中石油副总经理和总经理，网罗了一批亲信，这批人后来被称为中国的“石油系”。
Three other secretaries of Mr Zhou from his time with the national oil company have already been detained.
周永康在中石油任职期间的另外3名秘书此前已被拘留。
Separately, the New York Times reported that Liang Ke, director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of State Security, was taken into custody last month by the party’s discipline inspection body. 
此外，《纽约时报》(New York Times)报道称，北京市国家安全局局长梁克上月已被中纪委带走。
The newspaper said he had been detained because of suspected corruption but added that his links to Mr Zhou also were a factor.
该报道称，梁克被拘留的原因是涉嫌腐败，但该报道补充称，他与周永康的联系也是一个因素。
“Liang Ke was detained because he is suspected of assisting Zhou Yongkang beyond approved means and channels,” a former security official was quoted as saying.
该报道援引一名前安全部门官员的话称：“梁克被拘留也与他被怀疑帮助了周永康有关，他的做法超出许可的手段和渠道。”
Mr Zhou retired in 2012 and was last seen in public at a China University of Petroleum alumni celebration in October.
周永康已于2012年退休，最后一次公开露面是去年10月现身母校中国石油大学参加校庆活动。
He had been a close ally of Bo Xilai, the former leadership hopeful who in September received a life sentence for corruption.
周永康此前是薄熙来的亲密盟友。薄熙来曾有望进入最高领导层，去年9月以受贿罪被判无期徒刑。
China’s Communist party has long acknowledged corruption as an existential threat to its continued rule. 
中共长期以来一直承认，腐败对其持续统治构成生死存亡的威胁。
Since Xi Jinping took power in late 2012, Beijing has launched investigations targeting some of the country’s most powerful officials and companies as well as waging a broader campaign to rein in lavish spending by officials.
自习近平2012年末上台以来，中国政府将一些势力极大的官员和企业列为调查对象，并在全国发起一场整治官员奢侈浪费风气的运动。
Funds launched by the likes of Alibaba have been lambasted as parasites that are endangering China’s economic health by a prominent commentator, the latest salvo in a battle that pits new online funds against the traditional banking system they are shaking up.
中国一名知名评论员猛烈抨击阿里巴巴(Alibaba)等公司推出的基金，称其是危害中国经济健康的寄生虫。新型在线资金正在撼动传统的银行体系，在二者之间的角力中，上述抨击燃起了最新一轮战火。
The war of words over the weekend is a sign of the growing controversy over the online investment funds, which were launched less than a year ago but have already upended traditional business models in China’s banking system.
上周末期间爆发的口水战是一个迹象，表明围绕在线投资基金的争议越来越大。此类基金问世虽不到一年，但已颠覆了中国传统银行体系的商业模式。
Alibaba, the ecommerce company behind the biggest of the funds, shot back at the criticism, saying that its product is providing a service to the economy by putting more money in ordinary people’s hands.
在此类基金中，规模最大的一支是由电子商务公司阿里巴巴支持的。该公司回击了上述批评意见，称其产品正通过把更多的钱放到普通人手中而服务于中国经济。
The Chinese government caps bank deposit interest rates to limit what it fears could be damaging competition in the financial sector. 
中国政府对银行存款利率设定上限，以抑制金融行业中的竞争，因为它担心这种竞争可能具有破坏性。
Online investment funds offered by internet companies such as Alibaba and Tencent have blown a hole in that ceiling by giving savers direct access to money-market funds.
由阿里巴巴和腾讯(Tencent)等互联网公司提供的在线投资基金，让储户直接与货币市场基金对接，从而避开了这个上限。 
Thus depositors receive a maximum 0.35 per cent, while those investing in the Alibaba and Tencent funds are more than 15 times better off with an annual rate of 6 per cent – prompting a rechannelling of cash from banks to online funds.
储户的活期存款最高只能获得0.35%的利率，而那些投资于阿里巴巴和腾讯基金的人能够获得6%的年收益率，比前者高出15倍以上。这导致现金正从银行流出，转而流入在线基金。 
Regulators have so far done little to crimp the online funds’ development, viewing them as healthy innovations. 
监管部门迄今没有采取什么行动来打压在线基金的发展，视其为健康的创新。
But the attack by Niu Wenxin, a financial editor with the state broadcaster China Central Television, suggests they could begin to face tougher opposition. 
但官方的中国中央电视台(CCTV)证券资讯频道执行总编辑钮文新发起的上述抨击似乎表明，此类基金可能即将遭遇更加强烈的反对。
Mr Niu called for the outright prohibition of Alibaba’s Yu’e Bao fund.
钮文新呼吁取缔阿里巴巴的余额宝。 
“It is attacking the financing costs of Chinese society as a whole and attacking the overall economic safety of China,” he wrote in a blog post published on Friday. 
“它所冲击的是中国全社会的融资成本，冲击的是整个中国的经济安全。”他在上周五发表的一篇博文中写道，
“Yu’e Bao is like a vampire that has climbed on to the body of banks.”
“余额宝是趴在银行身上的‘吸血鬼’。”
With Mr Niu’s comments circulating widely, Alibaba used its official microblog early on Saturday to fight back. 
在钮文新的言论得到广泛转发之际，阿里巴巴上周六早上利用其官方微博发起反击。
In a post calculated to appeal to the general public, Alibaba said its fund was helping to make working people richer and the economy stronger.
阿里巴巴的博文意在争取公众支持，表示其基金正帮助劳动人民变得更加富裕、帮助中国经济变得更加强大。 
“I used to have just two steamed vegetable buns in the morning. Now I can have two meat buns! This motivates me to work that much harder for our motherland’s economy every day,” Alibaba said.
“您没看到自从有了余额宝我每天奋发工作的动力更强了吗？还不是因为平时每天早上只能吃俩菜包现在已经每天改吃俩肉的了！这让我每天干劲十足为祖国经济至少添砖加瓦多了好几块呢！”阿里巴巴的博文表示。
A poor country triples its trade volume in six years. Exports to its main partner soar fivefold. 
一个穷国的贸易额在6年时间里增长了两倍，对其主要贸易伙伴国的出口额飙升了5倍。
This is a rare feat for a nation not blessed with oil; rarer still for a country under UN Security Council sanctions, tightened three times during the same trade spurt.
这对一个石油匮乏的国家来说是个罕见的成就，再考虑到它还受到联合国(UN)安理会的制裁，能取得这样的成绩就更是难得了。在该国贸易额喷发式增长期间，联合国对其施加了3轮新制裁。
We are talking of North Korea, believe it or not. 
信不信由你，我们是在说朝鲜。
Unbelievers appear to include Kim Jong Un. 
不相信的人里似乎也包括金正恩(Kim Jong Un)。
When the young leader brutally purged his uncle-mentor, Jang Song Thaek, in December the charge sheet included “selling off precious resources of the country at cheap prices”.
当这位年轻领导人于去年12月无情地铲除他的姑父兼导师张成泽(Jang Song Thaek)时，判决书中所列的罪行包括“廉价出售国家宝贵资源。” 
China does receive some (not all) North Korean minerals cheap, since no one else will buy. 
中国确实以廉价获得朝鲜的部分（不是全部）矿产，因为不会有其他人来买。
But to be fair, on Jang’s watch – he oversaw trade with China – an economy still poorer on most indicators than when Moscow pulled the plug in 1991 began to grasp one big nettle: how to raise exports. 
但公平地说，在张成泽的掌管下（他负责管朝中贸易），朝鲜——从多数指标上看，朝鲜比1991年苏联解体时更加贫穷——开始果断地处理一个棘手问题：如何扩大出口？
Pyongyang issues no numbers; when they do that, we will know for sure reform is under way. 
朝鲜政府没有公布贸易数据，但假如它会公布，我们会明确地知道朝鲜正在进行改革。
But its partners’ recent trade statistics tell a striking story.
不过，朝鲜各贸易伙伴国近期的贸易数据却反映出一个惊人的现象。
North Korea has never traded much, and has always run a deficit. 
朝鲜从未开展过太多贸易活动，而且贸易总是处于逆差状态。
When the USSR collapsed, China was left as its main partner-cum-sponsor. 
苏联解体后，中国成了朝鲜最主要的贸易伙伴兼资助者。
For many years their trade was more like aid. 
许多年来，中朝之间的贸易更像是援助。
In the late 1990s the value of imports from China averaged about $500m a year – though often they were not paid for. 
20世纪90年代末，朝鲜从中国进口的货物平均每年为5亿美元左右，尽管朝方往往没有支付货款。
Pyongyang exported next to nothing in return. 
朝鲜没有对华出口多少东西。
The debts mounted, as did Chinese impatience. 
随着朝鲜的欠债越来越多，中国人也越来越不耐烦。
The deficit rose throughout the subsequent decade, reaching $1.3bn in 2008 – twice the level of Pyongyang’s exports.
朝鲜对华贸易逆差在接下来的10年里不断增长，在2008年达到13亿美元，比朝方出口额高出近一倍。
In 2012 South Korean news agency Yonhap noted a startling change. 
2012年，韩国新闻通讯社韩联社(Yonhap)报道了一个惊人的变化。
In just four years, starting in 2007, the value of trade had almost tripled to $5.6bn. 
从2007年起的4年时间里，朝鲜对华贸易额几乎增长了两倍，达到56亿美元。
At the same time, it became less one-sided; North Korea’s exports more than quadrupled to $2.5bn. 
同时，朝鲜对华贸易活动也不再是单向的：朝方出口额增长了3倍多，达到25亿美元。
That is still peanuts by regional and global standards, and the deficit narrowed rather than disappearing entirely. 
拿地区和全球的标准来衡量，这些数字微不足道，而且朝鲜的贸易逆差只是在缩小，并没有完全消除。
But it began to look like serious, reciprocal trade. 
但朝中贸易似乎开始朝真正意义上的、互有往来的贸易方向发展了。
The progress continues, if no longer at quite such a clip. 
这股势头得以延续，即使增长速度不再那么迅猛。
Latest Chinese customs statistics show that North Korean exports to China in 2013 rose 17 per cent to nearly $3bn, against imports of $3.6bn.
中国海关最近的数据显示，2013年朝鲜对华出口额接近30亿美元，同比增长17%，进口额为36亿美元。
China apart, North Korea has, or had, only one crucial partner: South Korea: Pyongyang’s trade with the rest of the world in 2012 totalled less than $800m, according to Seoul’s Bank of Korea. 
除了中国，朝鲜——这里或许应该说曾经——只剩下一个重要的贸易伙伴：韩国。据韩国央行(Bank of Korea)统计，2012年朝鲜与中韩以外地区的贸易额不到8亿美元。
In 2007 after a decade of “sunshine”, the engagement pursued by two liberal presidents, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, inter-Korean trade reached $1.8bn, snapping at China’s heels. 
2007年，在两位自由派韩国总统金大中(Kim Dae-jung)和卢武铉(Roh Moo-hyun)推行对朝“阳光政策”10年后，朝韩贸易额达到18亿美元，直追朝中贸易额。
South Korea briefly became the North’s biggest export market as the joint venture Kaesong Industrial Complex, in the North but near to Seoul, grew.
随着双方合作建设的开城工业园区(Kaesong Industrial Complex)不断发展，韩国一度成为朝鲜最大的出口市场。开城工业园地处朝鲜，但离首尔很近。
Larger plans were afoot. 
更宏伟的计划浮出水面。
In 2007, at the second North-South summit, accords were signed for co-operation on shipbuilding, mining, transport and more. 
2007年，在第二次韩朝峰会上，双方就造船、采矿、交通等方面的合作签署了系列协议。
A plethora of new joint committees started work quickly to implement all this. 
一大批新组建的联合委员会很快就投入工作，以落实相关协议。
For once the Koreas talked business, not politics.
朝韩双方谈商业而不谈政治，仅此一次。
Nothing came of it. 
但那轮合作无果而终。
At the end of that year, South Koreans elected as president Lee Myung-bak, who insisted the North must first give up nuclear weapons. 
2007年年底，韩国民众选举李明博(Lee Myung-bak)为总统，他坚持朝鲜必须首先放弃核武器。
The agreements were aborted and a downward spiral began. 
双方的协议被中止，情况急转直下。
In May 2010, after the sinking of a South Korean warship, Mr Lee banned all inter-Korean trade and all investment except at Kaesong.
2010年5月，在韩国一艘军舰沉没后，李明博禁止了与朝鲜的一切贸易，以及除开城以外的所有投资。
That zone alone still generated record North-South trade of $2bn in 2012. 
不过，单凭开城工业园，朝韩贸易额在2012年依然创纪录地达到20亿美元。
Meanwhile trade between China and North Korea leapt ahead. 
与此同时，朝中贸易也实现了跳跃式增长。
Last April, Mr Kim sabotaged Kaesong, pulling out the North’s workers. 
去年4月，金正恩宣布撤出开城工业园的全部朝鲜工人，给园区造成了损失。
It reopened in September but the closure meant inter-Korean trade fell 42 per cent in 2013 to $1.1bn: an eight-year low, and barely one-sixth the value of trade with China.
虽然开城工业园于9月重新开张，但园区关闭已导致2013年双边贸易额下降42%至11亿美元，为8年来最低，仅为朝中贸易额的六分之一。
North Korea is a risky place to do business, for Chinese as for others. 
无论是对中国人还是其他国家的人而言，在朝鲜做生意都要冒着很大风险。
Yet well-publicised horror stories may mislead. 
不过，那些广为流传的骇人故事或许具有误导性。
The numbers show that many Chinese companies have found a way to navigate the obstacles and make money. 
统计数字表明，许多中国企业找到了克服障碍和赚钱的法子。
They would not be there otherwise.
若非如此，他们就不会去朝鲜。
Beijing’s gain is Seoul’s loss. 
北京得利，韩国就受损。
Stillborn state-run projects aside, in the sunshine era a few bold companies from the South vied with China to do business in North Korea. 
除流产的国有项目之外，在阳光政策时期，曾有少数大胆的韩国企业在朝经商、与中国企业竞争。
Outside Kaesong they all lost their shirts. 
除开城之外，它们在朝鲜其他地方的生意全都血本无归。
Yet it was not Kim Jong Il, the current leader’s father and predecessor, but Mr Lee who did for them. 
然而，导致这种结果的并非金正日(Kim Jong Il)——朝鲜现任领导人的父亲和前任，而是李明博。
The sectors affected (mining above all) mourn the chances lost, but politicians are in denial. 
受到禁令影响的行业（采矿业首当其冲）叹惜失去了多少机会，但政客们拒不承认。
In January President Park Geun-hye told South Koreans to prepare for reunification, which she bizarrely called a “jackpot”. 
今年1月，韩国总统朴槿惠(Park Geun-hye)告诉韩国民众为半岛统一做好准备，她用了个怪异的说法，称统一能带来“巨大利益”(jackpot)。
But the Koreas can barely even agree to hold family reunions – the first in four years began this week – much less recoup ground lost under Mr Lee, whose trade ban remains in force.
但就连离散家属团聚问题，朝韩双方都仅能勉强达成共识（近日举行的朝韩离散家属团聚活动是4年来的首次），收复李明博时代所失去“阵地”这个问题就更别提了，他下达的贸易禁令如今也仍然有效。
Pyongyang always tries to play off its interlocutors against one another. 
平壤方面总是试图挑拨会谈各方的关系。
Conceivably, the mercurial Mr Kim might suddenly try to ditch China and re-embrace South Korea. 
可以想象，一向多变的金正恩或许会突然试图抛弃中国、向韩国重新示好。
But Beijing will not let him and the cautious Ms Park would not have him. 
但北京方面不会任由他这样做，一向谨慎的朴槿惠也不会接受他的示好。
Uncle Jang’s men may have fallen from favour but the trade ties he built will last. 
张成泽的人马或许已经失势，但他构建的贸易纽带将会延续下去。
Seoul blew its chance. 
首尔方面浪费了一个好机会。
North Korea’s future now lies with China.
朝鲜的未来如今系于中国身上。

China urges Obama to cancel Dalai Lama meeting
中国敦促奥巴马取消与达赖会面
China called on US President Barack Obama to immediately cancel a planned meeting with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, and warned the meeting would “severely impair” Sino-US relations if it goes ahead.
中国敦促美国总统巴拉克奥巴马立即取消与西藏精神领袖达赖喇嘛的会面计划，并警告说，如美方坚持会面，将“严重损害”中美关系。
Mr Obama is scheduled to welcome the exiled septuagenarian Tibetan leader at 10am Washington time on Friday and will spend just over an hour with him in the White House Map Room.
奥巴马预定将于华盛顿时间周五上午10点会见这位70多岁的西藏流亡领袖，会见地点选在白宫地图室，计划的会面时间为一个小时多一点。
Beijing regards the Dalai Lama as a political exile and a violent anti-China separatist and regularly imposes various sanctions and punishments on governments who meet him publicly.
在中国政府眼中，流亡中的达赖喇嘛是暴力的反华分裂主义者。对于公开会见达赖的国家政府，中国通常会施加种种制裁和惩罚。
The Tibetan leader is usually based in Dharamsala in India and has consistently advocated non-violence and repeatedly said he wants greater autonomy for Tibet rather than outright independence.
这位西藏领袖通常待在印度达兰萨拉，他一贯主张非暴力，并反复重申他希望西藏获得更大自治，而不是完全独立。 
“By arranging a meeting between the President and the Dalai Lama, the US side will grossly interfere in the internal affairs of China, seriously violate norms governing international relations and severely impair China-US relations,” a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday in Beijing.
中国外交部一位发言人周五在北京表示：“美方安排领导人会见达赖，将是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，严重违反国际关系准则，也将严重损害中美关系。”
The US President’s decision to meet the Dalai Lama is a show of concern for China’s human rights record but also appears aimed at warning Beijing it does not have the right to dictate who leaders of other countries can meet.
美国总统决定会见达赖喇嘛，表明了美国对中国人权状况的关切。不过，奥巴马这么做似乎也是为了警告中国政府，中国无权决定其他国家领导人能与何人见面。
Mr Obama has met the Dalai Lama twice before, in February 2010 and July 2011.
在此之前，奥巴马曾在2010年2月和2011年7月与达赖喇嘛会见过两次。
Like virtually every other country, the US recognises Tibet as part of China and does not support Tibetan independence but Washington also supports the Dalai Lama’s call for more autonomy and improvement in human rights.
和几乎所有其它国家一样，美国认同西藏是中国的一部分，不支持西藏独立。不过，美国政府也支持达赖喇嘛争取更大自治权以及改善人权状况的主张。
Diplomats and foreign policy analysts say European leaders are very unlikely to agree to a similar meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader in the wake of China’s livid response to meetings by the German, French and British heads of government in recent years.
一些外交官和外交政策分析人士表示，由于近年来中国政府对德国、法国和英国政府首脑会见这位西藏精神领袖都作出了愤怒回应，欧洲领导人不大会再举行类似会面。
Most recently, China reacted to a meeting between UK Prime Minister David Cameron and the Dalai Lama in May 2012 by cutting off all high-level diplomatic ties for more than a year.
英国首相戴维•卡梅伦在2012年5月会见达赖喇嘛之后，中国政府切断与英国高层外交关系长达一年多时间。
Relations only began to warm again after Mr Cameron reiterated Britain’s opposition to Tibetan independence in front of his colleagues in Parliament and later publicly stated he had no plans to meet the Dalai Lama again.
直到卡梅伦一再在英国议会里重申英国反对西藏独立的立场，随后又公开表示他无意再次会见达赖喇嘛之后，两国关系才重新和缓。
Tensions across the Tibetan plateau have been steadily rising in recent years, with widespread anger at Chinese religious and ethnic repression and the militarised occupation of many Tibetan areas.
近年来，西藏地区的紧张形势不断升级，藏民对中国政府的宗教和民族抑制政策，以及在西藏多地驻军的做法普遍怀有不满。
Since 2009, more than 120 Tibetans have set themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule and to call for the return of the Dalai Lama to his homeland.
从2009年起，已有120多位藏民自焚，以反对中国政府统治，呼吁达赖喇嘛重归故里。
Better-fed Chinese soldiers have trouble fitting into their tanks
中国军人需要更大规格装备
China already has the largest army in the world. 
中国拥有世界上最庞大的军队。
Now its soldiers are getting bigger too.
现在，中国军人的体型也越来越大了。
A People’s Liberation Army study has concluded that its soldiers are significantly taller and fatter than they were 20 years ago – so much so that they are in danger of outgrowing their equipment.
解放军的一项研究得出结论认为，如今这一代士兵比20年前显著更高更胖，以至于他们有不适合标准装备的危险。
The study recommended developing larger models of current military hardware because of the changed “parameters” of a generation raised on plentiful and fast food, compared with the austerity generation of the cultural revolution era.
研究报告建议，开发更大规格的现有军事装备，因为新一代人的体型“参数”已经发生了变化；与物质紧缺的文革时代相比，这一代人是吃着充足食物（包括快餐）长大的。
The average height of soldiers, it said, is now 2cm greater than two decades ago, and waistlines are 5cm larger, which makes sliding into tank hatches and fitting into aircraft cockpits especially tricky.
报告称，与20年前相比，士兵的平均身高上升了2厘米，腰围增大了5厘米，这意味着钻入坦克或飞机的驾驶舱变得特别局促。
Even the buttstocks of rifles produced for the PLA needed to be lengthened so as not to affect firing accuracy, the study said.
该研究报告称，就连专为解放军研制的步枪的枪托也需要加长，以免影响射击精度。
“The configuration of armaments and military personnel’s physique should be matched because that is the only way to ensure handy use of the equipment,” said Ding Songtao, director of the survey.
“什么样体型搭配什么样装备，这样装备才能得心应手，”项目负责人丁松涛表示。
Bigger tanks will be the focus of the new generation of roomier equipment. 
更大的坦克将成为新一代更宽敞装备的焦点。
The low silhouettes of China’s main battle tanks – based on the 30-year-old Russian T-series – make them more difficult targets, but their compartments are too cramped for today’s beefier crews.
中国主战坦克（基于已有30年历史的俄罗斯T-系列）的低轮廓使其成为更难瞄准的目标，但对于当今这一代体型较大的坦克兵来说，驾驶舱过于局促了。
Owing to better nutrition, China’s younger generation is now much taller than its parents, although obesity is a problem. 
由于营养改善，如今中国的年轻一代比其父母高得多，但肥胖也成为一个问题。
A study by China’s health ministry in 2007 showed that urban Chinese boys aged six are 6.3cm taller and 3kg heavier on average than boys 30 years ago.
中国卫生部2007年的一项研究显示，与30年前相比，6岁的中国城市男孩平均身高增加6.3厘米，体重增加3公斤。
But the conclusion that the PLA’s 2.3m active personnel needed a range of supersized military hardware was met by derision from some analysts.
但是，有关解放军230万现役军人需要一系列超大规格军事装备的结论，受到一些分析人士的嘲笑。
Jiang Lianju, a researcher with the China Academy of Military Sciences, said the size issue was a “very minor consideration” compared to technical specifications such as armour and combat effectiveness.
中国军事科学院研究员蒋联句（音）表示，与装甲和战斗力等技术规范相比，规格问题是一个“非常次要的考虑因素”。
Ni Lexiong, a military expert based in Shanghai, said height and weight had always been a consideration in choosing tank crewmen. 
上海的军事专家倪乐雄表示，身高和体重一直是解放军挑选坦克兵时的考虑因素。
“Choosing tank operators is like choosing weight-lifters – both require men to be short and quick.”
“挑选坦克操作员就像挑选举重运动员——两者都要求矮个、灵活的男性。”
Rather than building larger tanks, it was more likely that their inside compartments could be enlarged, keeping overall size unchanged, he said.
他表示，与其建造更大的坦克，更有可能的改良是在不增大总体尺寸的情况下扩大驾驶舱内的空间。
John Kerry warns China against declaring second air defence zone
克里警告中国勿再单方面划设防空识别区 
John Kerry, US secretary of state, warned China against declaring a second air defence zone three months after Beijing infuriated its neighbours by unilaterally declaring one over disputed islands in the East China Sea.
美国国务卿约翰•克里警告中国不要划设第二个防空识别区。3个月前，中国单方面在东海划设一个覆盖争议岛屿的防空识别区，激怒了邻国。 
Mr Kerry also said he sought agreement from Chinese officials to pursue their claims in the South China Sea in a peaceful manner, submit them for adjudication, and negotiate a code of conduct with other regional governments that would prevent maritime confrontations from getting out of control.
克里还表示，他寻求让中国官员同意以和平的方式声索中方在南海的主权主张，将这些主张提交裁决，并与地区其他国家的政府谈判达成一项行为准则，以防止海上对抗失控。
“It is important to resolve these disputes in a peaceful and non-confrontational way that honours the law of the sea and the rule of law in general,” he said during a visit to Beijing on Friday, amid heightened tensions between China and its neighbours over a range of maritime disputes.
“以和平及非对抗的方式解决这些纠纷，尊重海洋法和法治一般原则是很重要的，”他上周五在访问北京期间表示。目前中国与不止一个邻国在一系列海洋纠纷上紧张升级。
In November China unilaterally declared an “air defence identification zone” in the East China Sea which overlaps with a similar zone declared by Japan and covers a disputed chain of islands. 
去年11月，中国单方面在东海划设一个“防空识别区”，其范围与日本的防空识别圈部分重叠，还覆盖了一个有争议的岛群。
The US strongly criticised the move at the time as a “provocative” action. 
当时美国强烈批评此举是“挑衅”行为。
Ever since there has been speculation in the Chinese press about the declaration of a second ADIZ in the South China Sea to buttress territorial claims there.
自那以来，中国报刊不断猜测中国可能在南海划设第二个防空识别区，以支持中国在那里的领土主张。
Mr Kerry said in response to a question about a second ADIZ in the South China Sea: “With respect to the ADIZ we have indeed made clear our feelings about any unilateral announcements and I reiterated that again today. And I hope that whatever follows in the future will be done in an open transparent and accountable way.”
在答复有关在南海划设第二个防空识别区的问题时，克里表示：“在防空识别区的问题上，我们的确表明了我方对任何单方面宣布的感受，我今天再次重申了这一点。我希望未来无论出现什么，都能以一种开放透明和负责任的方式来完成。”
An ADIZ requires foreign aircraft entering the airspace to identify themselves, and Chinese officials have stressed it is not a territorial claim. 
防空识别区要求进入相关空域的外国飞机报告自己的身份，中国官员强调称，它不是一种领土要求。
But Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said the creation of the zone “may indirectly support territorial claims”.
但中国人民大学国际关系学院教授时殷弘表示，划设防空识别区“可能间接支持领土要求”。
Following criticism of the ADIZ last month, the US again singled out China’s territorial claims earlier this month when Daniel Russel, assistant secretary of state, said in testimony to the US Congress that China’s claim to much of the South China sea, known as the “nine dash line”, was “fundamentally flawed”. 
继上月批评中国的防空识别区之后，美国在本月早些时候再度点名批评中国的领土要求。美国国务院亚太事务助理国务卿丹尼•罗素在国会作证时表示，中国对南海大片海域的主权主张——即所谓的“九段线”是“有根本缺陷的”。
It was the first time the US has explicitly challenged the Chinese claim.
这是美国首次明确挑战中国的这一主张。
Wang Yi, Chinese foreign minister, told Mr Kerry on Friday that he hoped the US would respect China’s “sovereign rights”, “treat the issue objectively and fairly” and not take sides, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
据中国官方的新华社报道，中国外长王毅上周五对克里表示，他希望美国能够尊重中国的“主权权益”， “客观公正地看待有关问题”，切实不选边站队。
Tempers in Beijing are frayed because many Chinese believe they have the right to assert control of their environment in the western Pacific. 
目前北京方面态度强硬，因为很多中国人相信，他们有权掌控自身在西太平洋的环境。
Wu Shicun, director of the South China Sea Institute, said: “I don’t think the US has a right to interfere in the issue; the US is trying to use the South China Sea as a vehicle to contain China.”
中国南海研究院院长吴士存表示：“我不认为美国在这个问题上有干涉权；美国正试图利用南海作为一种工具来遏制中国。”
As we record this podcast, the Oscars are about to get underway in LA.
录制这期节目时，奥斯卡颁奖典礼即将在洛杉矶开幕。
It seems there is no limit to what celebrities will do to look their best during the Hollywood’s glamorous award season.
在这个好莱坞的颁奖季节，明星们为了显得光彩夺目可谓无所不用其极。
But beauty treatments of all kinds are big business in the US and not just for the stars.
美容行业是美国的一大产业，而且不是只有明星才去做整容。
According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons,
据美国整形外科协会称，
more than 15 million cosmetic surgery procedures were performed in the US last year.
去年，美国共有1500万例整容手术。
BBC’s Lee Pattison met two Los Angles doctors to see how treatments could actually help stars reveal the best versions of themselves.

We have people who come in who have to beg, borrow and steal, but they are doing the ‘vampire face-lift’.”
有些人哪怕沿街乞讨、四处借钱、坑蒙拐骗，也要做‘吸血鬼整容’手术。”
The sinister name comes from the fact that the procedure uses the patients’ own blood.
该手术要用患者自己的血液，因此才有了这个瘆人的名字。
It’s an especially popular pre-Oscars treatment because it’s non-invasive with little recovery time.
奥斯卡颁奖典礼之前，这种手术特别受欢迎，因为它是无创手术，而且术后恢复快。
And doctor Darrel sees results. Biopsies have been done and we have actually seen new tissue growth.
戴劳医生负责检查注射的结果。我们已经做了活体组织切片，而且亲眼看到长出了新的组织。
This is not just a mania of cosmetics. This is the new face-lift.” You look good. You wanna look better.

the quest for beauty is very very humane and really it’s to me about the quest for love and attention and approval and validation.
爱美之心，人皆有之。对我来说，对美的追求也是对爱、关心、赞许和认同的追求。
And that will never ever ever go away.”

You can actually see it under a microscope, which is really unusual for a virus and it’s the biggest scientists have found so old and revived.”

“And it’s under control or not?” “Yes. So the good news is this doesn't actually affect humans or animals.
“我们能控制住它吗?””可以，好在它并不影响人类和动物的生存。
But scientists all worried that there could be more deadly viruses lurking down there in the deep place at the permafrost, smallpox for example.
但是科学家担心，永冻土深处可能还隐藏着更多致命的病毒，比如天花。
That was around thousands of years ago. It’s eradicated now on the surface, but there is a chance if those deep places were penetrated.”
天花产生与几千年前，现在，从表面上看已经被根除，但很有可能已渗透到深层土壤。”

is likely to be seen as another show of Russian defiance in Crimea and another slap in the face for the international community.
但可能会被视为是俄罗斯对克里米亚的藐视，也是在国际社会脸上扇了一掌。

When The Boss Works Long Hours, Do We All Have To?
员工必须陪着上司加班吗？
The problem: Every night, your workaholic boss is still glued to the computer when you need to leave. 
题：每天晚上你想下班时，工作狂老板都还粘在电脑前。
How to go home without looking like a slacker?
怎么才能下班回家又不表现得像个懒鬼？
Should you sneak out, hoping to avoid a six o'clock showdown in the hall? 
你是怀着不会在大厅被上司撞见的侥幸心偷偷溜走呢？
Guiltily apologize, promising to be on email all night? 
还是充满歉意地道歉，承诺整晚都等着收电子邮件？
Or just walk straight toward the door in the most professional way you can?
还是以最职业的方式直接走向大门？
Many hard-working employees have an even harder-working boss who toils late into the night. 
许多辛勤工作的员工都有一个更加辛勤工作、经常加班到深夜的老板。
Career coaches and employees who have been there say the first priority should be conveying that you are still working hard -- and good at your job. 
职业咨询师和老员工称，最重要的是表现出你仍在辛勤工作──并且表现出色。
That requires communicating clearly and frequently about your progress and results. 
这需要经常明确地汇报你的工作进度和工作业绩。
Ideally, you want to figure out what the boss really needs and deliver it consistently enough that your hours become a non-issue.
最理想的做法是，弄明白上司的真正需要并持续交出满意的答卷，这样你的工作时间就不再是个问题了。
Many employees assume managers value people for working day and night, and workplace trends support that belief: Two-thirds of workers are putting in much longer hours on the job than five years ago, according to a poll of 325 employees last fall by Right Management, Milwaukee, a talent and career-management company.
许多员工认为，上司青睐没日没夜工作的人，而职场趋势也证明了这个观点：根据密尔沃基的人才与职业管理公司Right Management去年秋天对325名员工进行的一项调查，三分之二员工的工作时间多于五年前。
But before you get too hung up on work hours, check your assumptions about what the boss wants, says Cali Williams Yost, chief executive officer of Flex + Strategy Group, a Madison, N.J., training and consulting firm. 
但新泽西州麦迪逊的培训与咨询公司Flex + Strategy Group的首席执行长卡利·威廉斯·约斯特说，在你过度关注工作时间之前，请确认上司真正的期望。
Managers work long hours for a variety of reasons: It may be a personal habit or preference, or perhaps they just don't want to go home. 
上司加班有各种原因：可能是个人习惯或偏好，也可能只是因为他们不想回家。
'People make way too many guesses about managers' expectations that are just wrong,' Ms. Yost says.
约斯特说：“人们对上司期望的许多猜测都是错的。”
Bosses are often taken aback by employees' focus on their schedules. 
上司们常常惊讶于员工对他们工作时间的关注。
Betty Enyonam Kumahor often works 14-hour days, emailing and calling contacts around the world. 'My teams started tracking how many hours they thought I slept each night, based on my email 'send' times,' says Ms. Kumahor, a regional managing director in Atlanta for ThoughtWorks, a software-development company. 
软件开发公司ThoughtWorks的亚特兰大区域总经理贝蒂·埃约纳姆·库马霍经常每天工作14小时，通过电子邮件和电话与分处世界各地的其他人保持联系。
'They asked me jokingly, 'Do you ever sleep?'' She assured employees she would stop sending so many late-night and early-morning emails so they didn't have to extend their hours to respond.
她说：“我手下的各个团队开始根据我的电子邮件‘发送’时间猜测我每晚睡多少小时。他们开玩笑地问我：‘你睡觉吗？’”她向员工保证不会再频频在深夜或凌晨发送电子邮件，这样他们就不必熬夜等着回复她了。
When managers focus on employees' work hours, they are often looking for reassurance on other fronts: that their subordinates are meeting deadlines; that they can be reached when needed, and that they aren't creating extra work for colleagues, Ms. Yost says.
约斯特说，上司关注员工的工作时间，往往是为了保证其他方面的需要：比如，下属能在最后期限前完成工作，他们可以在需要时随叫随到，他们不会给同事增加额外工作，等等。
Rich Gee's boss on a former job took him aside and criticized him for leaving the office at 5 p.m., says Mr. Gee, a Stamford, Conn., executive coach. 
康涅狄格州斯坦福德(Stamford)的高管培训师里奇·吉说，在以前的一份工作中，上司曾把他叫到一边，批评他下午五点就下班。
The manager acknowledged that Mr. Gee was meeting deadlines and delivering good work; he arrived at the office at 6:30 a.m., two hours before his co-workers. 
这位上司承认，吉在最后期限前完成了工作并且表现出色，他早上6:30就到了办公室，比同事早两个小时。
The boss seemed nervous, however, that Mr. Gee wouldn't be available when needed. 
但是，上司似乎担心吉不能在需要时随叫随到。
Mr. Gee said he could be reached 24/7 by cellphone, and pointed out that he always responded quickly to emergency requests.
吉说，随时都可以打电话找到他，并指出他对紧急要求的反应一直很迅速。
He continued to leave the office at 5 p.m., but updated his boss often on his progress and results and checked in every evening before he left. 
他仍然在下午五点下班，但经常向上司汇报工作进展和工作业绩，而且每晚下班前都会知会一声。
In time, he says, his boss 'saw that it wasn't hours that mattered -- it was how hard I worked.'
他说，他的上司终于“发现工作时间并不重要──重要的是我工作有多努力”。
One key to Mr. Gee's solution: healthy communication. 
吉的解决方案的一个关键是：健康的沟通。
Employees should sit down with their bosses and ask them to define job objectives and time lines for reaching them, says Pat Katepoo, the Kaneohe, Hawaii-based owner of WorkOptions, a consulting firm. Then 'look for natural times to communicate about your progress, when you have a staff meeting or you're walking by or writing an email,' says Ms. Katepoo.
咨询公司WorkOptions的老板、夏威夷卡内奥赫(Kaneohe)的帕特·凯特普(Pat Katepoo)说，员工应该和上司一起坐下来，请他们明确工作目标和完成期限，然后“寻找汇报工作进展的合适时间，可以是开员工会议时，也可以是和上司碰面时或者是通过电子邮件”。
There are many ways to project a hard-working image. 
给上司留下努力工作的印象有许多方法。
If a manager speaks about a project in an intense, focused way, answer with similar intensity, acknowledging its importance and repeating the deadline, says Anne Brown, an advertising executive who has written about how young employees can deal with workaholic bosses in a book, 'Grad to Great,' and on a website she co-founded, GradtoGreat. 
密苏里州堪萨斯城的广告业高管安妮·布朗说，如果上司热情而专注地谈论某个项目，那么就以同样程度的热情作答，承认其重要性并重复最后期限。她在一本叫《职场成功之路》的书中以及她与别人共同创建的网站GradtoGreat上写到了年轻员工如何应对工作狂上司。
Manage time well in one-on-one meetings, moving quickly through your agenda, adds Ms. Brown, of Kansas City, Mo. And, of course, be prepared to work long hours during a crisis or busy season, or when a major project deadline is looming.
布朗补充道，在一对一会议中应该掌握好时间，快速完成议程。当然，在紧要关头或旺季时节，或重大项目的最后期限临近时也应该做好加班准备。
In some cases, shifting your work hours can help. 
在某些情况下，变更工作时段也是一种方法。
At companies where managers focus on face time, employees who work 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. -- when more people are present -- are more likely to get noticed than those who work 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
在上司关注员工露面时间的公司中，上午10点到晚上八点工作的员工──多数人上班的时间──比上午七点到下午五点工作的员工更容易得到注意。
Executive coach Michael Melcher was told in a previous job at an investment bank that 'I wasn't working long enough hours,' he says. 'I started coming in later and staying later,' he says. 
纽约Next Step Partners的高管培训师迈克尔·梅尔彻说，以前在一家投资银行工作时，曾被告知“我的工作时间不够长，我开始晚到并工作到更晚。
'A couple of months later, my boss said, 'It hasn't gone unnoticed that you're putting in additional hours.' '
几个月后，我的上司说：‘我注意到你的工作时间变长了。’”
Faking a presence at the office, however, doesn't work. 
不过，伪造在上班的假象是行不通的。
Throwing your coat over your chair as if you just stepped away, then leaving for the day, is likely to backfire, Ms. Yost says. 
约斯特说，将外套扔在椅子上，好像你在上班、只不过离开一小会儿，其效果只会事与愿违。
Colleagues will 'think you're there and run around like crazy people trying to find you.'
同事们可能会“认为你在，并疯了样地到处找你”。
Another nonstarter, says Mr. Melcher, an executive coach with Next Step Partners, New York, is 'being a whiny complainer, with a lot of exasperated sighs, saying you're working your fingers to the bone. Nobody wants to hear that.'
梅尔彻说，另一个不可取的做法是“爱发牢骚，总是唉声叹气，说你已经忙得四脚朝天了。没人想听这种话”。
In some professions, working long hours is unavoidable. 
在某些行业，加班是不可避免的。
Certain firms' cultures breed intense competition and long hours among new hires, says Julie Cohen, a Philadelphia career and personal coach. 
费城职业与私人培训师朱莉·科恩说，某些公司的文化鼓励新人激烈竞争和加班。
Others have unwritten cultural rules, such as, 'Nobody leaves the office before the boss leaves,' she says. 
还有些公司有不成文的企业文化，例如“上司下班前大家都不能下班”。
It is wise to prove yourself on the job for at least six months and ask a mentor for advice before exploring shorter hours, Ms. Cohen says. 
科恩说，明智的做法是，至少在六个月中证明自己胜任这份工作，并在希望缩短工作时间之前征求导师的建议。
'You might be stepping into a minefield if you don't understand the ins and outs of the organization.'
“如果你不了解公司的规则，可能会踏入雷区。”
To get the most out of a negotiation about hours, Mr. Melcher says, think in advance about the boss's needs, and bring specifics documenting your own performance. 
梅尔彻说，为了在关于工作时间的协商中争取最有利的结果，不妨提前考虑上司的需要，并提供证明自己工作业绩的详细资料。
Start on a positive note, talking about what's going well. 
你可以从一张措辞积极、谈论进展顺利工作的字条开始。
Ask what the boss expects of employees when it comes to work hours and responding to email. 
也可以询问上司对员工工作时间和回复邮件时间的期望。
To propose solutions, Mr. Melcher recommends the 'yes . . . 
梅尔彻推荐的解决方法是“是的……
and' technique: Affirm the boss's point, and then state your own. 
然后”技巧：肯定上司的观点，然后阐述你自己的观点。
For example: 'Yes, I want you to be able to rely on me after hours. And since I have young twins, it is important to me to be home between 5:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. and spend that time with family. I could respond to you between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. How does that sound?'
例如：“是的，我希望您在下班后也能找到我。然后我有两个双胞胎小孩，下午5:30到晚上8:00这段时间在家与家人度过对我来说很重要。我可以在晚上9:00到11:00处理工作。这样如何？”
Such conversations can open a dialogue -- or expose a brick wall. 
这样的谈话可以开启意见交换──也可能会碰壁。
When project manager Ashanti Stanford raised the issue with a boss at a previous job, the manager rolled her eyes and sighed. 'The expectation was, 'I have to work these hours, so why are you complaining?'' Ms. Stanford says. She has since moved on to a job with better hours.
项目经理阿珊提·斯坦福说，她在以前的一份工作中跟上司提出这个问题时，那位上司转转眼珠，叹了口气，说道：“我的想法是，‘既然我得在这些时间加班，你还抱怨什么呢？’”在那之后，斯坦福换了个上班时间更合适的工作。
It has long been said that a man with a good sense of humour can laugh a woman in to bed, despite his looks.
一直以来，人们都认为，一个幽默的男人能让女人开心，把女人哄上床，不论他相貌如何。
Now researchers believe the opposite may also be true - that we also find attractive members of the opposite sex more amusing.
现在研究人员认为，也许反过来说也是对的——研究发现，长得帅的男人更风趣。
Psychologists at the University of Stirling have discovered that good-looking people were perceived as funnier when the people listening to them could see what they looked like - i.e. whether they were attractive or not.
英国斯特灵大学的心理学家发现，当人们可以看到讲话者的面容（好看与否）时，长得好看的讲话者给人感觉更幽默。
In the study, undergraduate psychology students were videoed while being asked which two items they would take to a desert island, and why. 
在这一研究中，研究人员让一些心理学专业本科在读的学生回答将把哪两种东西带到荒岛上，并说出理由。
They could pick from either chocolate, hairspray or a plastic bag.
他们可以从巧克力、发胶或塑料袋里面选，整个问答过程都录成了视频。
While the students weren't told that the study was about humour, the vast majority gave the appearance of trying to be funny in their answers.
虽然研究人员没有告诉学生这一研究和幽默有关，但绝大部分学生看起来都努力想让自己的答案显得有趣。
Other students were then asked to rate the desert-island comments for wit, as well as how attractive each of the commenters might be for a short-term or long-term relationship.
其他一部分学生被要求给这些荒岛题回答的幽默感，以及各个应答者在短期或长期恋爱关系中的魅力指数打分。
The researchers found that attractive individuals were rated as funnier in video clips than their less dashing counterparts.
研究人员发现，长得好看的人在视频中的表现被认为比长相平凡的人更有趣。
Funnier men were also considered most attractive for a fling, the researchers found.
研究人员还发现，风趣的男人被认为在短暂恋情中最有魅力。
This might be because wit may give off the impression of not being serious or willing to commit to a long-term relationship.
这也许是因为风趣的外表会给人对待感情不认真或不愿意对长期感情关系负责的印象。
Being recorded on video also made a real difference. 
问答过程被录成视频也对结果产生了很大影响。
Men who were videoed were generally considered more amusing than those who only had their voices recorded and provided a photo of themselves.
一般来说，那些被录像的男人比那些只录下声音、提供个人照片的男人给人感觉更幽默。
One theory is that men, in particular, use humour as a mating signal, to show-off their intelligence and good genes to women.
研究人员提出的一个理论是，男人尤其喜欢把幽默作为一个交配信号来向女人展示自己的才智和优良基因。
Another is that we use wit to indicate we are sexually attracted to people.
另一个理论是，男人用风趣的谈吐来表明自己被异性吸引。
The study was published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.
该研究发表在《个性与个体差异》杂志上。
10 biggest patent troll targets in business
华为成国际专利流氓10大攻击目标之一
Wireless carrier AT&T (T) was the top target of so-called patent trolls in 2013, having been sued more than 54 times by them in 2013—more than once a week. 
2013年，无线运营商美国电话电报公司AT&T成为了 “专利流氓”的首要攻击目标。一年之内，AT&T被这类公司起诉达54次，平均下来每周超过一次。
This year's list of top ten patent troll targets was published today in a Fortune magazine feature story about RPX Corp.(RPXC), which compiled the statistics.
今天，《财富》杂志在一篇关于专利集成公司RPX Corp的专题报道中公布了这家公司统计、编撰的2014年“专利流氓十大目标公司”名单。
The article, called "Taking on the Trolls," states: "AT&T is no anomaly. Google (GOOG) was hit with 43 [such] suits last year; Verizon (VZ), 42; Apple (AAPL), 41; Samsung (SSNLF) and Amazon (AMZN), 39 each; Dell and Sony (SNE), 34 each; Huawei, 32; Blackberry (BBRY), 31. Every brand on this unenviable top-ten list was sued by [a patent troll] at least once every 12 days."
这篇标题为《迎接魔头的挑战》写道：“AT&T并不是一个特例。谷歌公司去年被起诉达43次，威瑞森通信被起诉42次，苹果公司被起诉41次，三星和亚马逊分别被起诉39次，戴尔索尼分别被起诉34次，华为32次，黑莓公司31次。进入这张榜单并不是一件令人羡慕的事，榜单中的这些公司至少12天就要被（专利流氓）起诉一次。”
"Patent troll" is a pejorative term. 
“专利流氓”这个称呼带有鄙夷的意味。
A more neutral term, and the one that RPX uses, is "non-practicing entity," or NPE. 
“专利流氓”这个称呼带有鄙夷的意味。
An NPE is a company that sells no products or services of its own. 
NPE公司本身不为他人提供任何产品或服务。
In their most controversial form, NPEs purchase patents on the open market and then assert them against operating companies, like AT&T and Google, seeking licensing fees and, often, suing to get them.
它们最具争议的做法是，在公开市场上购买各种专利，然后声称运营公司（比如AT&T或谷歌）使用了他们的专利，然后要求对方支付授权费。NPE拿到授权费的方式通常是向这些公司发起法律诉讼。
RPX is what's known as a defensive patent aggregator. 
RPX则是所谓的防御型专利集成公司。
In exchange for a subscription fee—currently paid by some 168 companies, including Google, Verizon, and Samsung—it attempts to buy up potentially problematic patents on the open market, before NPEs can get their hands on them.
RPX向公司收取会员费，然后赶在NPE动手之前，抢先买下公开市场上对成员公司具有潜在隐患的专利。目前RPX共有约168家客户，其中包括谷歌、威瑞森通信和三星。
According to RPX's statistics—which have been relied upon by academics and government agencies—NPEs filed 3,608 new suits in 2013, up 19% from the 3,042 they filed in 2012, and their suits named 4,843 total defendants, up 13% from the 4,282 sued a year earlier. 
学术及政府机构均仰仗RPX提供的统计数据。2013年，NPE共提起了3,608起诉讼，比2012年的3,042件增加了19%。这些诉讼指向的被告共有4,843名，比2012年的4,282名增加了13%。
NPE suits accounted for 67% of all new patent cases filed last year, and 63% of all new patent defendants, according to the figures RPX shared with Fortune.
根据它向《财富》杂志提供的资料，NPE提起的案件占去年全部专利案件的67%，被告人数为总被告人数的63%。

The Creature in the Shop
店铺里的怪物
My name is Dr Frederick Treves. I am a doctor at the London Hospital.
我是弗雷德里克·特里维斯博士，伦敦医院的医生。
One day in 1884, I saw a picture in the window of a shop near the hospital. 
1884年的一天，我在医院附近一家店铺的橱窗里看见了一张照片。
I stopped in front of the shop and looked at the picture. 
我停下来，看着这张照片。
At first I felt interested, then I felt angry, then afraid. 
起先我觉得这张照片挺有趣，后来就感到生气、害怕起来。
There was a man in the picture, but he did not look like you and me. 
照片上有个男人，但不像你和我。
He did not look like a man. He looked like an elephant.
他看上去不像个人，而像一头大象。
I read the writing under the picture. It said：Come in and see the Elephant Man. 2 pence.
我看了看照片下面的文字，上面写着：进来吧，看看这个象人，一次两便士。
I opened the door and went in.
我推开门走了进去。
There was a man in the shop. He was a dirty man in an old coat with a cigarette in his mouth. 
店里有个男人，穿着一件旧外套，嘴里叼着一支烟。
‘What do you want？’he asked.
“你想干什么？”他问道。
‘I'd like to see the elephant man, please, ’I said.
“我想看看象人。”我说。
The man looked at me angrily.
这个人生气地看着我。
‘Well, you can't, ’ he said. ‘The shop's closing now. You can come back tomorrow. ’
“不行。”他说，“店铺现在关门了，你明天来吧。”
‘I'm sorry, ’I said. ‘ But I would like to see him now. I have no time tomorrow—I have a lot of work to do. But I can give you more than 2 pence. ’
“对不起，”我说，“我想现在就看，明天我没有空，我有许多事情要做，我可以另外多给一些钱。”
The man looked at me carefully. Then he took the cigarette out of his mouth and smiled with his yellow teeth.
这个人仔细地打量着我，后来他取下嘴里的烟卷，露出了满嘴黄牙。
‘All right, sir, ’he said. ‘Give me twelve pence then. ’
他说，“好吧，先生。就给十二便士吧。”
I gave him the money and he opened a door at the back of the shop. 
我把钱给了他，他就打开了店铺后门。
We went into a little room. The room was cold and dark, and there was a horrible smell in it.
我们走进一个小房间，房间又冷又暗，里面一股恶心的气味。
A creature sat on a chair behind a table. 
一个怪物坐在桌子后面的椅子上。
I say a creature, because it was not a man or a woman, like you or me. 
我说那是一个怪物，它不像你和我，不是男人也不是女人。
The creature did not move or look at us. It sat very quietly on the chair in the cold, dark, dirty room, and looked at the table. On the table in front of it, there was a dead flower.
它一动不动地坐在这间又冷又暗又脏的房间里的椅子上，眼睛盯着桌子，由于阴冷，这个怪物的头上盖着一块布，在他面前的桌子上放着一朵枯萎的花。
‘Stand up! ’said the shopkeeper, loudly.
“站起来，”店老板大声地说。
The creature stood up slowly. It took the old cloth off its head, and put it on the chair.
怪物慢慢地站起来，取下头上的盖布放在椅子上。
I looked at the creature and felt sad. 
看着这个怪物，我感到很悲伤。
I am a doctor, so I know a lot about accidents and ill people. 
我是一个医生，我很了解事故和病人。
I see horrible, ugly things every day. But this creature, this thing, was the worst of all.
我每天要遇到许多可怕的、丑恶的东西，可这个怪物却是最糟糕的。
There were no men or women in the hospital like him.
医院里没有任何一个男人或女人像他这个样子。
He wore some old trousers, but no shirt, coat, or shoes, so I could see his body very well. 
他穿着条旧裤子，没有穿衬衫、外套和鞋子。所以，我可以清楚地看见他的身体。
His head was the most interesting thing. It was very, very big—like an enormous bag with a lot of books in it. 
他的头部最有趣，长得很大很大，就像一个装着许多书籍的大口袋。
The head did not have much hair, and there was another bag of brown, dirty skin at the back of it. This skin came down below his neck.
头上头发不多，脑后还耷拉着一块褐色的、肮脏的头皮，一直垂到脖子下面。
I could not see one of his eyes very well, because a lot of skin came down in front of his face, too.
我看不见他的一只眼睛，因为皮肤也从脸部垂下来。
An enormous red tooth came out of his mouth, under his nose. It looked like an elephant's tooth. The mouth and nose were like holes in the face. The face could not smile or laugh or look angry or sad, because the skin could not move. It was dead, like an elephant's face.
一颗巨大的红牙齿从嘴里露出来，就像一颗象牙，嘴和鼻子就像脸上开的洞，从他脸上看不出微笑还是大笑，也看不出生气和悲伤，因为这种皮肤无法活动，它已经失去活力，像一只大象的脸。
There were more bags of dirty skin on the front and back of the creature's body. These bags came down to his legs.
这个怪物身体的前胸和后背的脏皮肤上有许多囊肿，这种囊肿<包状物>一直拖到他的腿部。
The right arm was enormous, and there were bags of skin on it, too. The right hand was like a man's foot.
右臂巨大，皮肤上也有包状物，右手像男人的脚。
But the left hand the left arm and the left hand were beautiful! The left arm had wonderful skin, and the fingers of the left hand were long and beautiful. It was like a young woman's hand!
然而左手——左臂和左手——却是长得很美，左臂上有漂亮的皮肤，左指头纤长、美丽，就像年轻女人的手一样。
‘Walk, Merrick! ’ said the shopkeeper angrily. ‘Come on, quickly, move! ’
“走一走，麦里克！”店老板生气地说，“朝前走，动一动，快！”
He hit the creature with his hand.
他用手打着这个怪物。
Slowly, the creature walked across the room. 
慢慢地，这个怪物走到房间的对面。
But he could not walk well. His legs were very big and fat, and he had a bad back. He could not walk far without a stick.
可他走不好，他的腿又粗又肥，背部有病，没有拐杖走不远。
‘All right, thank you, ’I said. ‘Let him sit down. I don't want to see any more. ’
“好了，谢谢你，”我说，“让他坐下来，我不想再看什么了。”
I felt ill, and the smell in the room was very bad.
我感到恶心，房间里的气味难闻极了。
‘Yes, sir, ’said the shopkeeper. ‘Sit down, Merrick. ’
“好的，先生，”店老板说着。“坐下，麦里克。”
We went out of the room and closed the door.
我们走出房间，关上门。
The shopkeeper smiled at me with his yellow teeth.
店老板朝我笑了笑，露出满嘴黄牙。
‘Wonderful, sir, isn't it？’he said. ‘The best Elephant Man in England! Hundreds of people come to see him, you know, hundreds! I take him all over the country, I do! ’
“好极了，先生，是不是？”他说，“这是英国最棒的象人！成千上百的人来看他，知道吗？成千上百！我带他到全国各地去，真的！”
‘Yes, very interesting, ’I said. ‘Can I sit down？’
“挺有意思！”我说，“我可以坐下吗？”
‘Yes, sir, of course. Here's a chair. ’He looked at me, smiling. ‘Would you like a glass of water, sir？’
“当然可以，先生。请坐。”他朝我看了看，笑了笑说：“来杯水吗，先生？”
‘Yes, please, ’I said.
“谢谢，请给我一杯水，”我说。
Then I looked at the things in the dirty shop. There were two or three bad apples and some old black bananas：that was all. 
接着我朝脏商店里那些东西看着，有两三个坏苹果、几根烂香蕉。
‘Er, no…no, thank you. I'm all right, ’I said. ‘Did you…did you call the creature Merrick？’
“啊！不……不，谢谢，我没事！”我说。“你……你把这个怪物叫作麦里克吗？”
‘That's right, sir. Joseph Merrick. The best ElephantMan in England! I take him all over the country, you know. Lots of people want to see him. ’
“不错，先生，约瑟夫·麦里克。英国最棒的象人。我将把他带到全国各地去，你知道，许多人要看他。”
'What do you want?' said Mr Dombey.
“你需要什么？”董贝先生问道。
'If you please, Sir, I wish to speak to you,' said Susan.
“对不起，先生，我想跟您谈谈。”
Mr Dombey moved his lips as if he were repeating the words, but he seemed so lost in astonishment at the presumption of the young woman as to be incapable of giving them utterance.
董贝先生动了动嘴唇，仿佛在重复说这几个字；可是他似乎对这位年轻女人放肆无礼的态度诧异得不知所措，连也发不出来了。
'I have been in your service, Sir,' said Susan Nipper, with her usual rapidity, 'now twelve 'year a waiting on Miss Floy my own young lady who couldn't speak plain when I first come here and I was old in this house when Mrs Richards was new, I may not be Meethosalem, but I am not a child in arms.'
“我是您家的女用人，先生，”苏珊•尼珀就像平时那样快嘴快舌地说道，”我在这里已经十二年了，一直在服侍我的小女主人弗洛伊小姐，我初到这里来的时候她话还讲不清楚，当理查兹大嫂是这里的新用人的时候我已经是个老用人了，我可能不是梅索沙来姆，但我已经不是个抱在怀里的娃娃了。”
"You know my methods of work, Mr. Mac. But I will hold it back for the shortest time possible. I only wish to verify my details in one way, which can very readily be done, and then I make my bow and return to London, leaving my results entirely at your service. I owe you too much to act otherwise; for in all my experience I cannot recall any more singular and interesting study."
“麦克先生，你是知道我的工作方法的。但是我要在尽可能短的时间里保一下密，我只不过希望设法证实一下我想到的一切细节，这很容易做到。然后我就和你们告别，回伦敦，并把我的成果完全留下为你们效劳。不这样做，我就太对不起你们了。因为在我的全部经历中，我还想不起来哪件案子比这件更新奇、更有趣。”
"This is clean beyond me, Mr. Holmes. We saw you when we returned from Tunbridge Wells last night, and you were in general agreement with our results. What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?"
“我简直无法理解，福尔摩斯先生。昨晚我们从滕布里奇韦尔斯市回来看到你的时候，你大体上还同意我们的判断。后来发生了什么事，使你对本案的看法又截然不同了呢？”
"Well, since you ask me, I spent, as I told you that I would, some hours last night at the Manor House."
“好，既然你们问我，我不妨告诉你们。正如我对你们说过的，我昨夜在庄园里消磨了几个小时。”
Well, what happened?
那么，发生了什么事？
Ah, I can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment. 
啊！现在我权且给你们一个非常一般的回答。
By the way, I have been reading a short but clear and interesting account of the old building, purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist.
顺便说一下，我曾经读过一篇介绍资料，它简明而又有趣，是关于这座古老庄园的。这份资料只要花一个便士就可以在本地烟酒店买到，
Here Holmes drew a small tract, embellished with a rude engraving of the ancient Manor House, from his waistcoat pocket.
福尔摩斯从背心口袋里掏出一本小册子，书皮上印有这座古老庄园的粗糙的版画。
You are making fools of us, Mr. Holmes!
福尔摩斯先生，你别捉弄我们了。
“What use is your life to anyone? When I think of what you’ve made of it the phrase ‘pig’s ear’ comes irresistibly to my mind.”
“你的生命对任何人又有什么用呢？每当我想起你是怎样对待你的生命时，有个说法就会无法遏制地钻进我的脑子里，‘猪耳朵’，一文不值。”
“But I was President of the Galaxy, man!”
“可我毕竟当过银河系总统啊！”
“Huh,” muttered his ancestor, “And what kind of a job is that for a Beeblebrox?”
“哈，”他的祖先嘀咕道，“这份工作对一个毕博布鲁克斯来说，又能意味着什么呢？”
“Hey, what? Only President you know! Of the whole Galaxy!”
“什么？起码是你认识的惟一一个总统吧！整个银河系的！”
“Conceited little megapuppy.”
“狂妄的臭小子。”
Zaphod blinked in bewilderment.
赞福德困惑地眨着眼睛。
“Hey, er, what are you at, man? I mean Great Grandfather.”
“嘿——嗯，你又是什么呢，伙计？我是说，曾祖父。”
The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and tapped him sternly on the knee. This had the effect of reminding Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didn’t feel a thing.
这个驼背的小个子老人大踏步走到他的曾孙面前，严厉地敲打着他的膝盖。这样做的结果是提醒了赞福德，自己正在和一个鬼魂说话，因为他被敲打了却毫无感觉。
“You know and I know what being President means, young Zaphod. You know because you’ve been it, and I know because I’m dead and it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective. We have a saying up here. ‘Life is wasted on the living.’”
“你我都清楚，当个总统意味着什么，年轻的赞福德。你知道，是因为你已经当过了；我知道，是因为我已经死了，这给了我相当不错的洞察力，洞见秋毫。我们这儿有个说法，‘生命在活着时被浪费了’。”
“Yeah,” said Zaphod bitterly, “very good. Very deep. 
“是啊，”赞福德苦涩地说，“相当正确。相当深刻。
Right now I need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads.”
我现在需要的正是箴言，就像我需要在脑袋上多几个洞一样。”
“Fifty seconds,” grunted Ford Prefect.
“五十秒。”福特长官咕哝道。
“Where was I?” said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.
“我刚才说到哪儿了？”赞福德·毕博布鲁克斯四世问。
“Pontificating,” said Zaphod Beeblebrox.
“正在斩钉截铁大发议论。”赞福德·毕博布鲁克斯说。
“That’s right guys,” the computer sang out suddenly.
“说得对，伙计们。”电脑突然嚷了一句。
“just coping with that problem right now, and wow, it’s a biggy. Be with you in a while.” It lapsed back into a silence that was only matched for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at Arthur Dent.
“目前我正在解决这个问题。哇，这可是个棘手的大问题。你们再稍等一会儿。”说完它又恢复了沉默，正好和三双眼睛瞪着阿瑟·邓特时那种令人窒息的沉默相配。
As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to start firing.
似乎是为了缓解这种紧张气氛，沃贡人选择了在此刻开火。
The ship shook, the ship thundered. Outside, the inch thick force-shield around it blistered, crackled and spat under the barrage of a dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon, and looked as if it wouldn’t be around for long. 
飞船开始震荡，发出轰响。在一轮杀伤力三十级、高精度光辐射炮火的攻击下，船体周围一英寸厚的力场防护盾被打得千疮百孔，噼啪乱响，眼看撑不了多久了。
Four minutes is how long Ford Prefect gave it. 
按照福特长官的预计，顶多还有四分钟。
“Three minutes and fifty seconds,” he said a short while later.
“三分五十秒。”过了片刻，他说道。
“Forty-five seconds,” he added at the appropriate time. He flicked idly at some useless switches, then gave Arthur an unfriendly look.
“四十五秒，”他又补报出当前最准确的时间。他漫不经心地拨弄着一些无用的开关，然后狠狠剜了阿瑟一眼。
“Dying for a cup of tea, eh?” he said. “Three minutes and forty seconds.”
“就这么死在一杯茶上，嗯？”他说，“三分四十秒。”
“Will you stop counting!” snarled Zaphod.
“拜托，你能停止计数吗？”赞福德咆哮着说。
“Yes,” said Ford Prefect, “in three minutes and thirty-five seconds.”
“当然，”福特长官回答道，“三分三十五秒钟以后吧。”
To distinguish real friends from real enemies, we must make a general analysis of the economic status of the various classes in Chinese society and of their respective attitudes towards the revolution.
我们要分辨真正的敌友，不可不将中国社会各阶级的经济地位及其对于革命的态度，作一个大概的分析。
At the slightest provocation they make arrests, crown the arrested with tall paper hats, and parade them through the villages, saying, "You dirty landlords, now you know who we are! "
动不动捉人戴高帽子游乡，“劣绅！今天认得我们！”
Since this theory impedes the rise of the peasant movement and so disrupts the revolution, we must firmly oppose it.
这种理论，阻碍农民运动的兴起，其结果破坏了革命，我们不能不坚决地反对。
"We joined the peasant association long ago," they say to the rich peasants, "why are you still hesitating? # The rich peasants answer mockingly, "What is there to keep you from joining? # You people have neither a tile over your heads nor a speck of land under your feet! "
他们对着富农说：“我们早进了农会，你们为什么还迟疑？”富农带着讥笑的声调说道：“你们上无片瓦，下无插针之地，有什么不进农会！
We must combat the counter-revolutionary talk of a "movement of riffraff" and a "movement of lazy peasants" and must be especially careful not to commit the error of helping the local tyrants and evil gentry in their attacks on the poor peasant class.
我们要反对那些所谓“痞子运动”、“惰农运动”的反革命议论，尤其要注意不可做出帮助土豪劣绅打击贫农阶级的错误行动。
Therefore, our present task is to lead the peasants to put their greatest efforts into the political struggle, so that the landlords' authority is entirely overthrown.
我们只须知道中国白色政权的分裂和战争是继续不断的，则红色政权的发生、存在并且日益发展，便是无疑的了。
"Well, well," said Holmes gleefully, "you have indeed done some solid work while I have been sitting spinning theories with my friend! It's a lesson in being practical, Mr. Mac."
“很好，很好，"福尔摩斯高兴地说道，“你们确实做了一件扎实的工作，而我却和我的朋友坐在这里编造各种推论。麦克先生，这的确是一次教训呢。是得多做些实际的工作啊。”
"Ay, it's just that, Mr. Holmes," said the inspector with satisfaction.
“当然，这话不错，福尔摩斯先生，"警官麦克唐纳满意地说道。
"But this may all fit in with your theories," I remarked.
“可是这也完全符合你的推论啊，"我提醒说。
"That may or may not be. But let us hear the end, Mr. Mac. Was there nothing to identify this man?"
“那也说不定。不过，让我们听听结果如何吧，麦克先生。没有什么线索可以查清这个人吗？”
So little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself against identification. 
很明显，他非常小心谨慎提防着，不放别人认出他来。
There were no papers or letters, and no marking upon the clothes. 
既没有文件也没有书信，衣服上也没有特记。
A cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table. 
他卧室桌上有一张本郡的自行车路线图。
He had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle, and no more was heard of him until our inquiries.
昨天早晨，他吃过早饭，骑上自行车离开旅馆，直到我们去查问为止，也没有再听到他的情况。
"That's what puzzles me, Mr. Holmes," said White Mason. 
“福尔摩斯先生，这正是使我迷惑不解的，"怀特·梅森说道。
If the fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him, one would imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist. 
如果这个人不想叫人怀疑他，他就应当想到，他必须返回旅馆，并且象一个与事无关的游客那样呆在那里。
As it is, he must know that he will be reported to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with the murder.
象现在这样，他应当知道，旅馆主人会去向警察报告的，必然要把他的失踪和凶杀案联系起来。
So one would imagine. 
人家是要这样想的。
Still, he has been justified of his wisdom up to date, at any rate, since he has not been taken. 
既然还没有捉到他，至少直到现在证明他还是机智的。
But his description--what of that?
不过他的外貌特征到底是什么样的呢？
MacDonald referred to his notebook.
麦克唐纳查看了一下笔记本。
He stopped again, as if to discover whether he had led Mr Dombey far enough yet. And again, with his chin resting on his hand, he leered at the picture.
他又停住，仿佛想看一看他把董贝先生是不是已经引得够远了，然后，他又用手支托着下巴，斜眼看着那张图画。
'Carker,' said Mr Dombey, 'I am sensible that you do not limit your - '
“卡克，”董贝先生说道，”我知道您并不限制您的--”
'Service,' suggested his smiling entertainer.
“服务，”请他吃早饭的主人笑嘻嘻地提示道。
'No; I prefer to say your regard,' observed Mr Dombey; very sensible, as he said so, that he was paying him a handsome and flattering compliment, 'to our mere business relations. Your consideration for my feelings, hopes, and disappointments, in the little instance you have just now mentioned, is an example in point. I I am obliged to you, Carker.'
“不，我宁肯说是您的关心，”董贝先生说道；他很清楚，他这么说是给了他一个很大的讨他喜欢的恭维。”我知道，您并不把您的关心局限于我们之间纯粹的业务关系方面。您刚才提到的那件小事就是个很好的例子，说明您关心我的感情、希望和失望。我感谢您，卡克。”
“Yes,” said Ford Prefect, “in three minutes and thirty-five seconds.”
“当然，”福特长官回答道，“三分三十五秒钟以后吧。”
Experience has shown that in enemy-occupied areas it is best not to magnify the class contradiction among the Chinese; the basic idea should be to unite all Chinese in the fight against the enemy.
经验证明：在敌占区不应该去扩大中国人自己的阶级矛盾，基本是团结一切中国人对敌。
Experience has also shown that achieving unity of the Chinese against the enemy involves a struggle, too.
经验又证明：团结中国人对敌，也包含有斗争。
Fifth, they should at all times secretly look after the interests of the Chinese people, especially anti-Japanese revolutionaries.
第五，随时注意在隐蔽的方式下，照顾中国人特别是革命抗日分子的利益。
Doing Everything to Safeguard the Interests of the Chinese People.
尽一切努力保护中国人的利益。
Members of our guerrilla units and armed working teams in enemy-occupied areas should aim at safeguarding the interests of the Chinese people; this is a matter of preserving the might of the country and building up our strength and is the starting point of our revolutionary work in these areas.
我们的游击队武工队工作人员在敌占区的活动，必须以保护中国人利益为前提，这是保存国力与积蓄力量的问题，是在敌占区发展革命工作的起点。
Since there are 450 million people in China and only 2 billion people in the world, our victory will mean the victory of one-fourth of the world's population.
因为我们中国有四万万五千万人口，全世界才二十万万人口，我们的胜利就是世界四分之一人口的胜利。
Therefore, opposing feudalism is a fundamental task of the Chinese revolution.
所以反对封建主义是中国革命的一个根本任务。
In “Introducing The Communist”, Chairman Mao pointed out that the united front, armed struggle and Party building are the three fundamental questions in the Chinese revolution.
毛主席在《〈共产党人〉发刊词》中指出，中国革命的三个基本问题，一个是统一战线问题，一个是武装斗争问题，一个是党的建设问题。
The reason for our victory in the Chinese revolution was that we successfully handled the three questions.
中国革命之所以胜利，是三个问题都解决得好。
In China most of the minority nationalities live in the northwest and southwest.
我们中国的少数民族最多的地区，一个是西北，一个是西南。
Historically, China's minority nationalities have been estranged to a high degree from the Han nationality.
在中国的历史上，少数民族与汉族的隔阂是很深的。
We should convince the various minority nationality people that, politically, all nationalities within China's boundaries are truly equal, that their living standards can be improved and that their cultural level can be raised.
要使他们相信，在政治上，中国境内各民族是真正平等的；在经济上，他们的生活会得到改善；在文化上，也会得到提高。
In China, Mao Zedong Thought -- the integration of the theory of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution --can also help solve this problem.
在中国，马列主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想，也是能够解决这个问题的。
The Characteristics of the Chinese Bourgeoisie.
中国资产阶级的特点。
The Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held 11 years ago, laid down the following principle: we shall integrate the universal truth of Marxism and Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution as a guide for our country's revolution and development.
十一年前，中国共产党第七次全国代表大会确定了这样的原则，即马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合，以此来指导我国的革命，指导我国的建设。
These were the first words of antagonism. 
这些是他们发生冲突后第一次说的话。
To fling elaborate sarcasms at Tess, however, was much like flinging them at a dog or cat. 
把这些巧妙的讽刺用到苔丝身上，就完全像把它们用到猫和狗的身上一样。
The charms of their subtlety passed by her unappreciated, and she only received them as inimical sounds which meant that anger ruled. 
她领会不到话里微妙的辛辣意味，她只是把它们当作敌意的声音加以接受，知道那表示他在忍受着愤怒。
She remained mute, not knowing that he was smothering his affection for her. 
她保持着沉默，不知道他也正在抑制着对她的感情。
She hardly observed that a tear descended slowly upon his cheek, a tear so large that it magnified the pores of the skin over which it rolled, like the object lens of a microscope. 
她也没有看见一滴泪水慢慢地从他的脸上流下来，那是一滴很大的泪水，好像是一架放大镜的目镜，把它流过去的皮肤上的毛孔都放大了。
Meanwhile reillumination as to the terrible and total change that her confession had wrought in his life, in his universe, returned to him, and he tried desperately to advance among the new conditions in which he stood. 
与此同时，他又重新明白过来，她的自白已经完全把他的生活、他的宇宙全都改变了，他想在他新处的环境里前进，但是他绝望了。
Some consequent action was necessary; yet what?
必须做点儿什么；做什么呢？
'Tess,' he said, as gently as he could speak, 'I cannot stay - in this room - just now. I will walk out a little way.'
“苔丝，”他说，尽量把话说得轻松些，“我不能住在——这个房间里了——就是现在。我要到外面走一走。”
He quietly left the room, and the two glasses of wine that he had poured out for their supper - one for her, one for him - remained on the table untasted. 
他悄悄地离开了房间，他先前倒出来两杯葡萄酒准备吃晚饭，一杯是倒给她的，一杯是倒给自己的，那两杯酒现在还放在桌子上，动也没有动。
This was what their Agape had come to. 
这就是他们一场婚宴的下场。
At tea, two or three hours earlier, they had, in the freakishness of affection, drunk from one cup.
在两三个小时以前，他们吃茶点时还相亲相爱，用一个杯子喝酒。
The closing of the door behind him, gently as it had been pulled to, roused Tess from her stupor. 
房门在他的身后关上了，就像门被轻轻地拉开一样，但把苔丝从昏沉中惊醒了。
He was gone; she could not stay. 
他已经走了；她也呆不住了。
Hastily flinging her cloak around her she opened the door and followed, putting out the candles as if she were never coming back. 
她急忙把大衣披在身上，打开门跟着走了出去，出去时她把蜡烛吹灭了，仿佛再也不回来似的。
The rain was over and the night was now clear.
雨已经停了，夜晚也清朗了。
She was soon close at his heels, for Clare walked slowly and without purpose. 
不久她就走到了他的身后，因为克莱尔漫无目的，走得很慢。
His form beside her light gray figure looked black, sinister, and forbidding, and she felt as sarcasm the touch of the jewels of which she had been momentarily so proud. 
在她谈白色的身影旁边，他的身影是黑色的，阴沉而叫人害怕，她脖子上带的珠宝，她曾一时为之感到骄傲，现在却叫她感到是一种讽刺了。
Clare turned at hearing her footsteps, but his recognition of her presence seemed to make no difference in him, and he went on over the five yawning arches of the great bridge in front of the house.
克莱尔听见了她的脚步声，转过身来，不过他虽然认出是她来了，但是却似乎没有改变态度，又继续往前走，走过屋前那座有五个拱洞的大桥。
The cow and horse tracks in the road were full of water, the rain having been enough to charge them, but not enough to wash them away. 
路上奶牛和马的脚印都积满了水，天上下的雨水虽然把它们淹没了，但是却没有把它们冲刷掉。
Across these minute pools the reflected stars flitted in a quick transit as she passed; 
小水坑映出天上的星星，她从水坑旁边走过的时候，天上的星星也就一闪而过；
she would not have known they were shining overhead if she had not seen them there - the vastest things of the universe imaged in objects so mean.
她要是没有看见水坑里的星星，她就不会知道星星正在她的头顶上闪烁——宇宙中最大的物体竟反映在如此卑微的东西中。
The place to which they had travelled to-day was in the same valley as Talbothays, but some miles lower down the river; and the surroundings being open she kept easily in sight of him. 
他们今天到的这个地方，还是在泰波塞斯的同一个山谷里，不过在下游几英里的地方；四周是空旷的平地，她很容易就能看见他。
Away from the house the road wound through the meads, and along these she followed Clare without any attempt to come up with him or to attract him, but with dumb and vacant fidelity.
有一条路从屋子那儿伸展开去，蜿蜒着穿过草地，她就沿着这条道路跟在克莱尔的后面，不过她并不想追上他，也不想吸引他，而只是默不作声、漫无目的地跟在后面。
At last, however, her listless walk brought her up alongside him, and still he said nothing. 
她没精打采地走着，后来终于走到了克莱尔的身边，不过他仍然没有说话。
The cruelty of fooled honesty is often great after enlightenment, and it was mighty in Clare now. 
诚实如果遭到愚弄，一旦明白过来，常常就会感到巨大的残酷；克莱尔现在的感受就是这样的。
The outdoor air had apparently taken away from him all tendency to act on impulse; she knew that he saw her without irradiation - in all her bareness; 
户外的空气显然已经消除了他全凭冲动行事的所有倾向；她知道他现在看见她，是觉得她毫无光彩了——她的一切都是平淡无奇了；
that Time was chanting his satiric psalm at her then--
这时候，时光老人正在吟诵讽刺他的诗句——
Behold, when thy face is made bare, he that loved thee shall hate;
看吧，你的脸一暴露出来，爱你的他就要恨你；
Thy face shall be no more fair at the fall of thy fate.
在你倒霉的时候，你的脸也不再美丽。
For thy life shall fall as a leaf and be shed as the rain;
你的生活就像秋叶飘零，像天上的落雨；
And the veil of thine head shall be grief, and the crown shall be pain.
你头上的面纱就是悲伤，花冠就成了痛苦。① 
He was still intently thinking, and her companionship had now insufficient power to break or divert the strain of thought. 
他仍然在聚精会神地想着，她的陪伴现在已经没有足够的力量打断或改变他的思想之流。
What a weak thing her presence must have become to him! 
现在她对于他已经变得无足轻重了！
She could not help addressing Clare.
她禁不住对克莱尔说开了。
'What have I done - what have I done! I have not told of anything that interferes with or belies my love for you. You don't think I planned it, do you? It is in your own mind what you are angry at, Angel; it is not in me. O, it is not in me, and I am not that deceitful woman you think me!'
“我做了什么事了——我究竟做了什么事了！我告诉你所有的事，没有一句是假的，或者是装的呀。你不要以为我是在骗你呀，你说是不是？安琪尔，你是在跟你心中想的事生气，而不是在和我生气，是不是？啊，不是在生我的气，我并不是像你认为的那样，是一个骗人的女人哪！”
'H'm - well. Not deceitful, my wife; but not the same. No, not the same. But do not make me reproach you. I have sworn that I will not; and I will do everything to avoid it.'
“哼——好啦。我的妻子不是一个骗人的女人；但已经不是原来同一个人了。不是了，不是同一个人了。但是不要让我责备你。我已经发誓不会责备你；我会尽力不责备你的。”
But she went on pleading in her distraction; and perhaps said things that would have been better left to silence.
但是她发狂似地恳求着；说了许多也许不如不说的话。
'Angel! - Angel! I was a child - a child when it happened! I knew nothing of men.'
“安琪尔！——安琪尔！我还是个孩子啊——事情发生的时候我还是个孩子啊！男人的事我还一点也不懂啊。”
'You were more sinned against than sinning, that I admit.'
“与其说你犯了罪，不如说别人对你犯了罪，这我承认。”
'Then will you not forgive me?'
“那么你是不会宽恕我的了？”
'I do forgive you, but forgiveness is not all.'
“我的确宽恕你了，但是这不是宽恕的问题呀。”
'And love me?'
“你还爱我吗？”
To this question he did not answer.
关于这个问题，他没有回答。
O Angel - my mother says that it sometimes happens so! 
啊，安琪尔——我母亲说有时候会发生这种事的！
- she knows several cases where they were worse than I, and the husband has not minded it much - has got over it at least. 
——她就知道好几个这样的例子，比我的情形还要严重啦，但是她们的丈夫都并没有怎样在乎——至少没有成为他们之间的障碍啊。
And yet the woman has not loved him as I do you!
可是她们爱她们的丈夫，都不如我爱你呀！
Don't, Tess; don't argue. 
不要说了，不要辩解了。
Different societies, different manners. 
社会不同，规矩就不同。
You almost make me say you are an unapprehending peasant woman, who have never been initiated into the proportions of social things. 
你都快要让我说你是一个不懂事的乡下女人了，从来都不懂得世事人情。
You don't know what you say.
你都不知道你说的是什么呀。
'I am only a peasant by position, not by nature!'
“从地位上看我是一个农民，但是从本质上看我并不是一个农民呀！”
She spoke with an impulse to anger, but it went as it came.
她冲动地说，生起气来，但是气还没有生出来就消失了。
So much the worse for you. 
这对你来说更是糟糕透顶。
I think that parson who unearthed your pedigree would have done better if he had held his tongue. 
我倒觉得那个把你的祖先考证出来的牧师，如果他闭上嘴巴反而更好些。
I cannot help associating your decline as a family with this other fact - of your want of firmness. 
我忍不住要把你们家族的衰败同另外的事联系起来——同你缺少坚定联系起来。
Decrepit families imply decrepit wills, decrepit conduct. 
衰败的家族就意味着衰败的意志，衰败的行为。
Heaven, why did you give me a handle for despising you more by informing me of your descent! 
老天啊，你为什么要告诉我你的身世，给我一个把柄，让我更加瞧不起你呢？
Here was I thinking you a new-sprung child of nature; there were you, the belated seedling of an effete aristocracy!
我原来以为你是一个自然的新生女儿；谁知道你竟是一个没落了的贵族家庭的后裔呢！
Her narrative ended; even its re-assertions and secondary explanations were done. 
苔丝把事情讲述完了；甚至连反复的申明和次要的解释也作完了。
Tess's voice throughout had hardly risen higher than its opening tone; there had been no exculpatory phrase of any kind, and she had not wept.
她讲话的声调，自始至终都同她开始讲述时的声调一样，几乎没有升高；她没有说一句辩解的话，也没有掉眼泪。
But the complexion even of external things seemed to suffer transmutation as her announcement progressed. 
但是随着她的讲述，甚至连外界事物的面貌也似乎发生了变化。
The fire in the grate looked impish - demoniacally funny, as if it did not care in the least about her strait. 
炉桥里的残人露出恶作剧的样子，变得凶恶可怖，仿佛一点儿也不关心苔丝的不幸。
The fender grinned idly, as if it too did not care. 
壁炉的栅栏懒洋洋的，也似乎对一切视而不见。
The light from the water-bottle was merely engaged in a chromatic problem. 
从水瓶里发出来的亮光，只是一心在研究颜色的问题。
All material objects around announced their irresponsibility with terrible iteration. 
周围一切物质的东西，都在可怕地反复申明，它们不负责任。
And yet nothing had changed since the moments when he had been kissing her; or rather, nothing in the substance of things. 
但是自从他吻她的时候以来，什么也没有发生变化；或者不如说，一切事物在本质上都没有发生变化。
But the essence of things had changed.
但是一切事物在本质上又发生了变化。
When she ceased the auricular impressions from their previous endearments seemed to hustle away into the corners of their brains, repeating themselves as echoes from a time of supremely purblind foolishness.
她讲完过去的事情以后，他们从前卿卿我我的耳边印象，好像一起挤到了他们脑子中的一个角落里去了，那些印象的重现似乎只是他们盲目和愚蠢时期的余音。
Clare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire; the intelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him. 
克莱尔做一些毫不相干的事，拨了拨炉火；他听说的事甚至还没有完全进入到他的内心里去。
After stirring the embers he rose to his feet; all the force of her disclosure had imparted itself now. 
他在拨了拨炉火的余烬以后，就站了起来；她自白的力量此刻发作了。
His face had withered. 
他的脸显得憔悴苍老了。
In the strenuousness of his concentration he treadled fitfully on the floor. 
他想努力把心思集中起来，就在地板上胡乱地来回走着。
He could not, by any contrivance, think closely enough; that was the meaning of his vague movement. 
无论他怎样努力，他也不能够认真地思考了；所以这正是他盲目地来回走着的意思。
When he spoke it was in the most inadequate, commonplace voice of the many varied tones she had heard from him.
当他说话的时候，苔丝听出来，他的最富于变化的声音变成了最不适当和最平常的声音。
'Tess!'
“苔丝！”
'Yes, dearest.'
“哎，最亲爱的。”
Am I to believe this? 
难道要我相信这些话吗？
From your manner I am to take it as true. 
看你的态度，我又不能不把你的话当成真的。
O you cannot be out of your mind! 
啊，你可不像发了疯呀！
You ought to be! Yet you are not... . My wife, my Tess - nothing in you warrants such a supposition as that?'
你说的话应该是一番疯话才对呀！可是你实在正常得很……我的妻子，我的苔丝——你就不能证明你说的那些话是发了疯吗？”
'I am not out of my mind,' she said.
“我并没有发疯！”她说。
'And yet--' He looked vacantly at her, to resume with dazed senses: 'Why didn't you tell me before? Ah, yes, you would have told me, in a way - but I hindered you, I remember!'
“可是——”他茫然地看着她，又心神迷乱地接着说：“你为什么以前不告诉我？啊，不错，你本来是想告诉我的——不过让我阻止了，我记起来了。”
These and other of his words were nothing but the perfunctory babble of the surface while the depths remained paralyzed. 
他说的这一番话，还有其它的一些话，只不过是表面上应付故事罢了，而他内心里却像是瘫痪了一样。
He turned away, and bent over a chair. 
他转过身去，伏在椅子上。
Tess followed him to the middle of the room where he was, and stood there staring at him with eyes that did not weep. 
苔丝跟在后面，来到房间的中间，用那双没有泪水的眼睛呆呆地看着他。
Presently she slid down upon her knees beside his foot, and from this position she crouched in a heap.
接着她就软倒在地上，跪在他的脚边，就这样缩成了一团。
'In the name of our love, forgive me!' she whispered with a dry mouth. 'I have forgiven you for the same!'
“看在我们爱情的份上，宽恕我吧！”她口干舌燥地低声说。“我已经同样地宽恕你了呀！”
And, as he did not answer, she said again--
但是他没有回答，她又接着说——
'Forgive me as you are forgiven! I forgive you, Angel.'
“就像我宽恕你一样宽恕我吧！我宽恕你，安琪尔。”
'You - yes, you do.'
“你——不错，你宽恕我了。”
'But you do not forgive me?'
“可是你也应该宽恕我呀？”
'O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case! You were one person; now you are another. My God - how can forgiveness meet such a grotesque - prestidigitation as that!'
“啊，苔丝，宽恕是不能用在这种情形上的呀！你过去是一个人，现在你是另一个人呀。我的上帝——宽恕怎能同这种荒唐事用在一起呢——怎能像变戏法一样呢！”
He paused, contemplating this definition; then suddenly broke into horrible laughter - as unnatural and ghastly as a laugh in hell.
他停住了口，考虑着宽恕的定义；接着，他突然发出一阵可怕的哈哈大笑——这是一种不自然的骇人的笑声，就像是从地狱里发出来的笑声一样。
'Don't - don't! It kills me quite, that!' she shrieked. 'O have mercy upon me - have mercy!'
“不要笑了——不要笑了！这笑声会要了我的命的！”她尖叫着。“可怜我吧——可怜我吧！”
He did not answer; and, sickly white, she jumped up.
他没有回答；她跳起来，脸色像生了病一样苍白。
'Angel, Angel! what do you mean by that laugh?' she cried out.'Do you know what this is to me?'
“安琪尔，安琪尔！你那样笑是什么意思呀？”她叫喊说。“你这一笑对我意味着什么，你知道吗？”
He shook his head.
他摇摇头。
'I have been hoping, longing, praying, to make you happy! I have thought what joy it will be to do it, what an unworthy wife I shall be if I do not! That's what I have felt, Angel!'
“为了让你幸福，我一直在期盼，渴望，祈祷！我想，只要你幸福，那我该多高兴呀，要是我不能让你幸福，我还能算什么妻子呢！这些都是我内心的感情呀，安琪尔！”
'I know that.'
“这我都知道。”
I thought, Angel, that you loved me - me, my very self! 
我想，安棋尔，你是爱我的——爱的是我这个人！
If it is I you do love, O how can it be that you look and speak so? 
如果你爱的的确是我，啊，你怎能那样看我，那样对我说话呢？
It frightens me! 
这会把我吓坏的！
Having begun to love you, I love you for ever - in all changes, in all disgraces, because you are yourself. 
自从我爱上你以来，我就会永远爱你——不管你发生了什么变化，受到什么羞屏，因为你还是你自己。
I ask no more. 
我不再多问了。
Then how can you, O my own husband, stop loving me?
那么你怎能，啊，我自己的丈夫，不再爱我呢？
'I repeat, the woman I have been loving is not you.'
“我再重复一遍，我以前一直爱的那个女人不是你。”
'But who?'
“那是谁呢？”
'Another woman in your shape.'
“是和你一模一样的另外一个女人。”
She perceived in his words the realization of her own apprehensive foreboding in former times. 
她从他的说话中看出，她过去害怕和预感到的事出现了。
He looked upon her as a species of impostor; a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one. 
他把她看成了一个骗子；一个伪装纯洁的荡妇。
Terror was upon her white face as she saw it; her cheek was flaccid, and her mouth had almost the aspect of a round little hole. 
她意识到这一点，苍白的脸上露出了恐惧；她的脸颊的肌肉松弛下来，她的嘴巴差不多变成了一个小圆洞的样子。
The horrible sense of his view of her so deadened her that she staggered; and he stepped forward, thinking she was going to fall.
他对她的看法竟是如此的可怕，她呆住了，身子摇晃起来；安琪尔走上前去，认为她就要跌倒了。
'Sit down, sit down,' he said gently. 'You are ill; and it is natural that you should be.'
“坐下来，坐下来，”他温和地说。“你病了；自然你会感到不舒服的。”
She did sit down, without knowing where she was, that strained look still upon her face, and her eyes such as to make his flesh creep.
她坐了下来，却不知道她坐在什么地方。她的脸仍然是紧张的神情，她的眼神让安琪尔看了直感到毛骨悚然。
'I don't belong to you any more, then; do I, Angel?, she asked helplessly. 'It is not me, but another woman like me that he loved, he says.'
“那么我再也不属于你了，是不是，安琪尔？”她绝望地问。“他说他爱的不是我，他爱的是另外一个和我一模一样的女人。”
The image raised caused her to take pity upon herself as one who was ill-used. Her eyes filled as she regarded her position further; she turned round and burst into a flood of self-sympathetic tears.
出现的这个女人的形象引起了她对自己的同情，觉得自己是受了委屈的那个女人。她进一步想到了自己的情形，眼睛里充满了泪水；她转过身去，于是自怜的泪水就像决堤的江水一样流了出来。
Clare was relieved at this change, for the effect on her of what had happened was beginning to be a trouble to him only less than the woe of the disclosure itself. He waited patiently, apathetically, till the violence of her grief had worn itself out, and her rush of weeping had lessened to a catching gasp at intervals.
看见她大哭起来，克莱尔心里倒感到轻松了，因为刚才发生的事对苔丝的影响开始让他担心起来，其程度仅仅次于那番自白本身引起的痛苦。他耐心地、冷漠地等着，等到后来，苔丝把满腹的悲伤发泄完了，泪如涌泉的痛哭减弱了，变成了一阵阵抽泣。
'Angel,' she said suddenly, in her natural tones, the insane, dry voice of terror having left her now. 'Angel, am I too wicked for you and me to live together?'
“安琪尔，”她突然说，这时候她说话的音调自然了，那种狂乱的、干哑的恐怖声音消失了。“安琪尔，我太坏了，你是不能和我住在一起了是不是？”
'I have not been able to think what we can do.'
“我还没有想过我们该怎么办。”
'I shan't ask you to let me live with you, Angel, because I have no right to! I shall not write to mother and sisters to say we be married, as I said I would do; and I shan't finish the good-hussif I cut out and meant to make while we were in lodgings.'
“我不会要求你和我住在一起的，安琪尔，因为我没有权利这样要求！本来我要写信给我的母亲和妹妹，告诉她们我结婚了，现在我也不给她们写信了；我裁剪了一个针线袋子，打算在这儿住的时候缝好的，现在我也不缝了。”
'Shan't you?'
“你不缝了！”
'No, I shan't do anything, unless you order me to; and if you go away from me I shall not follow 'ee; and if you never speak to me any more I shall not ask why, unless you tell me I may.'
“不缝了，除非你吩咐我做什么，我是什么也不做了；即使你要离开我，我也不会跟着你的；即使你永远不理我，我也不问为什么，除非你告诉我，我才问你。”
'And if I do order you to do anything?'
“如果我真地吩咐你做什么事呢？”
'I will obey you like your wretched slave, even if it is to lie down and die.'
“我会听你的，就像你的一个可怜的奴隶一样，甚至你要我去死我也会听你的。”
'You are very good. But it strikes me that there is a want of harmony between your present mood of self-sacrifice and your past mood of self-preservation.'
“你很好。但是这让我感到，你现在自我牺牲的态度和过去自我保护的态度少了一些协调。”
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
凡是有钱的单身汉，总想娶位太太，这已经成了一条举世公认的真理。这样的单身汉，每逢新搬到一个地方，四邻八舍虽然完全不了解他的性情如何，见解如何，可是，既然这样的一条真理早已在人们心目中根深蒂固，因此人们总是把他看作自己某一个女儿理所应得的一笔财产。
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
有一天班纳特太太对她的丈夫说：“我的好老爷，尼日斐花园终于租出去了，你听说过没有？”
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
班纳特先生回答道，他没有听说过。
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
“的确租出去了，”她说，“朗格太太刚刚上这儿来过，她把这件事的底细，一五一十地告诉了我。” 
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
班纳特先生没有理睬她。
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently. 
“你难道不想知道是谁租去的吗？”太太不耐烦地嚷起来了。
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
“既是你要说给我听，我听听也无妨。”
This was invitation enough. 
这句话足够鼓励她讲下去了。
Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.
哦！亲爱的，你得知道，郎格太太说，租尼日斐花园的是个阔少爷，他是英格兰北部的人；听说他星期一那天，乘着一辆驷马大轿车来看房子，看得非常中意，当场就和莫理斯先生谈妥了；他要在‘米迦勒节’以前搬进来，打算下个周未先叫几个佣人来住。
What is his name?
这个人叫什么名字？
Is he married or single?
有太太的呢，还是单身汉？
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
“噢！是个单身汉，亲爱的，确确实实是个单身汉！一个有钱的单身汉；每年有四五千磅的收入。真是女儿们的福气！”
"How so? how can it affect them?"
“这怎么说？关女儿女儿们什么事？”
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
“我的好老爷，”太太回答道，“你怎么这样叫人讨厌！告诉你吧，我正在盘算，他要是挑中我们一个女儿做老婆，可多好！”
"Is that his design in settling here?"
“他住到这儿来，就是为了这个打算吗？”
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
“打算！胡扯，这是哪儿的话！不过，他倒作兴看中我们的某一个女儿呢。他一搬来，你就得去拜访拜访他。”
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for, as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
“我不用去。你带着女儿们去就得啦，要不你干脆打发她们自己去，那或许倒更好些，因为你跟女儿们比起来，她们哪一个都不能胜过你的美貌,你去了，彬格莱先生倒可能挑中你呢？”
My dear, you flatter me. 
我的好老爷，你太捧我啦。
I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. 
从前也的确有人赞赏过我的美貌，现在我可有敢说有什么出众的地方了。
When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.
一个女人家有了五个成年的女儿，就不该对自己的美貌再转什么念头。
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, "I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."
班纳特先生尽管在自己太太面前自始至终都说是不想去拜访彬格莱先生，事实上一直都打算去拜访他，而且还是跟第一批人一起去拜访他的。等到他去拜访过以后，当天晚上太太才知道实情。这消息透露出来的经过是这样的－－他看到第二个女儿在装饰帽子，就突然对她说： “我希望彬格莱先生会喜欢你这顶帽子，丽萃。”
"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."
她母亲气愤愤地说：“我们既然不预备去看彬格莱先生，当然就无从知道他喜欢什么。”
"But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him."
“可是你忘啦，妈妈，”伊丽莎白说，“我们将来可以在跳舞会上碰到他的，郎格太太不是答应过把他介绍给我们吗？”
"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her."
“我不相信郎格太太肯这么做。她自己有两个亲侄女。她是个自私自利、假仁假义的女人，我睢不起她。”
"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."
“我也瞧不起她，”班纳特先生说；“你倒不指望她来替你效劳，这叫我听到高兴。”
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
班纳特太太没有理睬他，可是忍不住气，便骂起女儿来。 
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."
“别那么咳个不停，吉蒂，看老天爷份上吧！稍许体谅一下我的神经吧。你简直叫我的神经要胀裂啦。”
"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill."
“吉蒂真不知趣，”她的父亲说；“咳嗽也不知道拣个时候。”
"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.
“我又不是故意咳着玩儿。”吉蒂气恼地回答道。
When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?
你们的跳舞会定在那一天开，丽萃？
"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."
“唔，原来如此，”她的母亲嚷道，“郎格太太可要挨到开跳舞会的前一天才能赶回来；那么，她可来不及把他介绍给你们啦，她自己也还不认识他呢。” 
Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.
那么，好太太，你正可以占你朋友的上风，反过来替她介绍这位贵人啦。
Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?
办不到，我的好老爷，办不到，我自己还不认识他呢；你怎么可以这样嘲笑人？
"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself."
“我真佩服你想得这般周到。两个星期的认识当然谈不上什么。跟一个人相处了两个星期，不可能就此了解他究竟是怎样一个人。不过，要是我们不去尝试尝试，别人可少不了要尝试的。话说到底，郎格太太和她的侄女一定不肯错过这个良机。因此，要是你不愿意办这件事，我自己来办好了，反正她会觉得这是我们对她的一片好意。”
The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"
女儿们都对父亲瞪着眼。班纳特太太只随口说了声：“毫无意思！” 
"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. 
“你怎么这样大惊小怪！”他嚷道。
Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? 
你以为替人家效点儿劳介绍是毫无意思的事吗？
I cannot quite agree with you there. 
你这样的说法我可不大同意。
What say you, Mary? 
你说呢，曼丽？
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts.
我知道你是个有独到见解的少女，读的书都是皇皇巨著，而且还要做札记。
Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.
曼丽想说几句有见识的话可又不知道怎么说才好。
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr. Bingley."
于是班纳特先生接下去说：“让曼丽仔细想一想再发表意见吧，我们还是重新来谈谈彬格莱先生。”
"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.
“我就讨厌谈彬格莱先生，”他的太太嚷起来了。
I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me so before? 
遗憾得很，你竟会跟我说这种话；你怎么不早说呢？
If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him. 
要是今天上午听到你这样说，那我当然不会去拜访他啦。
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.
这真叫不凑巧。现在既然拜访也拜访过了，我们今后就少不了要结交这个朋友。
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.
果然不出他所料，娘儿们一听此说，一个个都大这惊异，尤其是班纳特太太，比谁都惊异得厉害；不过，这样欢天喜地地喧嚷了一阵以后，她便当众宣布，说这件事她早就料到的。 
How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! 
你真是个好心肠的人，我的好老爷！
But I knew I should persuade you at last. 
我早就知道你终究会给我说服的。
I was sure you loved our girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. 
你既然疼爱自己的女儿，当然就不会把这样一个朋友不放在心上。
Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.
我真太高兴了！你这个玩笑开得真太有意思，谁想到你竟会今天上午去拜访他，而且到现在一字不提。
"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
“吉蒂，现在你可以放心大胆地咳嗽啦，”班纳特先生一面说，一面走出房间，原来他看到太太那样得意忘形，不免觉得有些厌恶。
"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut. "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. 
门一关上，班纳特太太便对她的几个女儿说“孩子们，你们的爸爸真太好了，我不知道你们怎样才能报答他的恩典；再说，你们还应该好好报答我一番呢。
At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing. 
老实跟你们说吧，我们老夫妻活到这么一把年纪了，哪儿有兴致天天去交朋结友；可是为了你们，我们随便什么事都乐意去做。
Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball."
丽迪雅，乖宝贝，虽然你年纪最小，开起跳舞会来，彬格莱先生或许就偏偏要跟你跳呢。”
"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I'm the tallest."
“噢！”丽迪雅满不在乎地说。“我才不当它一回事。年纪虽然是我最小，个儿算我顶高。”
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.
于是她们一方面猜测那位贵人什么时候会来回拜班纳特先生，一方面盘算着什么时候请他来吃饭，就这样把一个晚上的工夫在闲谈中度过去了。
Angel sat down, and the place felt like home; yet he did not so much as formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there. 
安琪尔坐下来，这时候才觉得回到了家里；不过和大家坐在一起，他倒觉得缺少了自己过去有过的自己是家庭一员的感觉。
Every time that he returned hither he was conscious of this divergence, and since he had last shared in the Vicarage life it had grown even more distinctly foreign to his own than usual. 
从前他每次回到家里，都意识到这种分歧，但是自从上次回家住了几天以后，他现在感触到这种分歧明显变得比过去更大了，他和他们越来越陌生了。
Its transcendental aspirations - still unconsciously based on the geocentric view of things, a zenithal paradise, a nadiral hell - were as foreign to his own as if they had been the dreams of people on another planet. 
家里那种玄妙的追求，仍然还是以地球为万物中心的观点为基础的，也就是说，天上是天堂，地下是地狱，这种追求和他自己的相比，它们就变得陌生了，陌生得就像它们是生活在其它星球上的人做的梦一样。
Latterly he had seen only Life, felt only the great passionate pulse of existence, unwarped, uncontorted, untrammelled by those creeds which futilely attempt to check what wisdom would be content to regulate.
近来他看见的只是有趣的生活，感觉到的只是强烈激情的搏动，由于这些信仰，它们没有矫饰，没有歪曲，没有约束，这些信仰只能由智慧加以节制，而是不能够压制的。
On their part they saw a great difference in him, a growing divergence from the Angel Clare of former times. 
在他的父母方面，他们也在他的身上看出了巨大的不同，看到了同在前几次里看到的安琪尔·克莱尔的差别。
It was chiefly a difference in his manner that they noticed just now, particularly bis brothers. 
他们所注意到的这种差别主要是他的外表上的，他的两个哥哥注意到的尤其如此。
He was getting to behave like a farmer; he flung his legs about; the muscles of his face had grown more expressive; his eyes looked as much information as his tongue spoke, and more. 
他的表现越来越像一个农民，抖他的双腿，脸上易于表现喜怒哀乐的情绪，富有表情的眼睛传达的意思甚至超过了舌头。
The manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared; still more the manner of the drawing-room young man. 
读书人的风度差不多消逝了；客厅里的青年人的风度更加看不见了。
A prig would have said that he had lost culture, and a prude that he had become coarse. 
道学先生会说他没有教养，假装正经的人会说他举止粗野。
Such was the contagion of domiciliary fellowship with the Talbothays nymphs and swains.
这就是他在泰波塞斯同大自然的儿女们住在一起而受到熏陶感染的结果。
After breakfast he walked with his two brothers, non-evangelical, well-educated, hall-marked young men, correct to their remotest fibre; such unimpeachable models as are turned out yearly by the lathe of a systematic tuition. 
早饭以后，他和他的两个哥哥一起出门散步，他的两个哥哥都是非福音教徒，受过良好的教育，他们都是高品位的青年，品行端正，性格谨慎；他们都是由教育机床一年年生产出来的无可挑剔的模范人物。
They were both somewhat shortsighted, and when it was the custom to wear a single eyeglass and string they wore a single eyeglass and string; when it was the custom to wear a double glass they wore a double glass; when it was the custom to wear spectacles they wore spectacles straightway, all without reference to the particular variety of defect in their own vision. 
他们两个人都有点儿近视，那个时候时兴戴系带子的单片眼镜，所以他们就戴系带子的单片眼镜；如果时兴戴夹鼻眼镜，他们就戴夹鼻眼镜，而从不考虑他们有毛病的眼睛的特殊需要。
When Wordsworth was enthroned they carried pocket copies; and when Shelley was belittled they allowed him to grow dusty on their shelves. 
当有人崇拜华兹华斯的时候，他们就带着华兹华斯的袖珍诗集，当有人贬低雪莱的时候，他们就把雪莱的诗集扔在书架上，上面落满了灰尘。
When Correggio's Holy Families were admired, they admired Correggio's Holy Families; when he was decried in favour of Velasquez, they sedulously followed suit without any personal objection.
当有人称赞柯累佐的画《神圣家庭》的时候，他们也称赞柯累佐的画《神圣家庭》；当有人诋毁柯累佐而赞扬维拉奎的时候，他们也紧跟在后面人云亦云，从来没有自己的不同意见。
If these two noticed Angel's growing social ineptness, he noticed their growing mental limitations. 
如果说他的两个哥哥注意到了安琪尔越来越不合社会世俗，那么他也注意到了他的两个哥哥在心智上越来越狭隘。
Felix seemed to him all Church; Cuthbert all College. 
在他看来，费利克斯似乎就是整个社会，卡斯伯特似乎就是所有的学院。
His Diocesan Synod and Visitations were the main-springs of the world to the one; Cambridge to the other. 
对费利克斯来说，主教会议和主教视察就是世界的主要动力；对卡斯伯特来说，世界的主要动力则是剑桥。
Each brother candidly recognized that there were a few unimportant scores of millions of outsiders in civilized society, persons who were neither University men nor churchmen; but they were to be tolerated rather than reckoned with and respected.
他们每一个人都坦诚地承认，在文明的社会里，还有千千万万的无足轻重的化外之人，他们既不属于大学，也不属于教会；对他们只需容忍，而无需尊敬和一视同仁。
They were both dutiful and attentive sons, and were regular in their visits to their parents. 
他们是两个孝顺的儿子，定期回家看望他们的父母。
Felix, though an offshoot from a far more recent point in the devolution of theology than his father, was less self-sacrificing and disinterested. 
在神学的发展变化中，虽然费利克斯和他的父亲相比是更新的一支的产物，但是却缺少了父亲的牺牲精神，多了自私自利的特点。
More tolerant than his father of a contradictory opinion, in its aspect as a danger to its holder, he was less ready than his father to pardon it as a slight to his own teaching. 
和他的父亲相比，对于和他相反的意见，他不会因为这种意见对坚持这种意见的人有害就不能容忍，但是这种意见只要对他的说教有一点儿害处，他可不会像他父亲那样容易宽恕别人。
Cuthbert was, upon the whole, the more liberal-minded, though, with greater subtlety, he had not so much heart.
总的说来，卡斯伯特是一个气量更加宽宏的人，不过他虽然显得更加敏感，但是却少了许多勇气。
'I suppose it is farming or nothing for you now, my dear fellow,' Felix was saying, among other things, to his youngest brother, as he looked through his spectacles at the distant fields with sad austerity. 
“我想你现在一心想的就是农业了，别的什么也不想了，是不是，我的朋友？”费利克斯带着悲伤和严肃的神情，透过眼镜看着远方的田野，在说完了其它的事情后对他的弟弟说。
And, therefore, we must make the best of it. 
因此，我们只能尽力而为了。
But I do entreat you to endeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with moral ideals. 
不过我还是劝你千万努力，尽可能不要放弃了道德理想。
Farming, of course, means roughing it externally; but high thinking may go with plain living, nevertheless.
当然，农业生产就是意味着外表的粗俗；但是，高尚的思想无论怎样也可以和简朴的生活结合在一起呀。
'Of course it may,' said Angel. 'Was it not proved nineteen hundred years ago - if I may trespass upon your domain a little? Why should you think, Felix, that I am likely to drop my high thinking and my moral ideals?'
“当然可以，”安琪尔说。“如果我可以班门弄斧地说一句话，这不是在一千九百年以前就被证明了的吗？费利克斯，为什么你要以为我可能放弃高尚思想和道德理想呢？”
'Well, I fancied, from the tone of your letters and our conversation - It may be fancy only - that you were somehow losing intellectual grasp. Hasn't it struck you, Cuthbert?'
“啊，从你写的信中，从你和我们谈话的口气中——我猜想——这只是猜想——你正在慢慢地丧失理解力。你有没有这种感觉，卡斯伯特？”
Now, Felix, said Angel drily, 
听着，费利克斯，安琪尔冷冷地说。
we are very good friends, you know; each of us treading our allotted circles; 
你知道，我们都相处得非常好；我们各自做各自的事；
but if it comes to intellectual grasp, I think you, as a contented dogmatist, had better leave mine alone, and inquire what has become of yours.
不过如果说到理解力的话，我倒觉得你作为一个踌躇满志的教条主义者，最好不要管我的事，还是先问问你自己的事怎么样了。
They returned down the hill to dinner, which was fixed at any time at which their father's and mother's morning work in the parish usually concluded. 
他们转身下山，回家吃午饭，午饭没有固定的时间，他们的父亲和母亲什么时候结束了上午在教区的工作，就什么时候吃饭。
Convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last thing to enter into the consideration of unselfish Mr and Mrs Clare; though the three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to wish that their parents would conform a little to modern notions.
克莱尔先生和克莱尔太太不是自私自利的人，最后还要考虑的是下午来拜访的人方不方便；但是在这件事上，三个儿子却非常一致，希望他们的父母多少能适合一点儿现代观念。
The walk had made them hungry, Angel in particular, who was now an outdoor man, accustomed to the profuse dapes inemptae of the dairyman's somewhat coarsely-laden table. 
他们走路走得肚子饿了，安琪尔饿得尤其厉害，他现在是在户外工作的人，已经习惯了在奶牛场老板的简陋饭桌上吃那些丰富的廉价食物。
But neither of the old people had arrived, and it was not till the sons were almost tired of waiting that their parents entered. The self-denying pair had been occupied in coaxing the appetites of some of their sick parishioners, whom they, somewhat inconsistently, tried to keep imprisoned in the flesh, their own appetites being quite forgotten.
但是两个老人谁也没有回家，直到几个儿子等得不耐烦了，他们才走进门来。原来两个只顾别人的老人，一心劝说他们教区里几个生病的教民吃饭，自相矛盾地要把他们囚禁在肉体的牢狱里，而把他们自己吃饭的事全给忘了。
The family sat down to table, and a frugal meal of cold viands was deposited before them. 
一家人围着桌子坐下来，几样素朴的冷食摆在他们的面前。
Angel looked round for Mrs Crick's black-puddings, which he had directed to be nicely grilled, as they did them at the dairy, and of which he wished his father and mother to appreciate the marvellous herbal savours as highly as he did himself.
安琪尔转身去找克里克太太送给他的血肠，他已经吩咐按照在奶牛场烤血肠的方法把它们好好地烤一烤，他希望他的父亲和母亲能像他自己一样，非常喜欢这种加了香料的美味血肠。
'Of course,' said Angel cheerfully, looking round for the mead.
“当然不会，”安琪尔快活地说，回头去找蜜酒。
'I found the mead so extremely alcoholic,' continued his mother, 'that it was quite unfit for use as a beverage, but as valuable as rum or brandy in an emergency; so I have put it in my medicine-closet.'
“我尝过了，那蜜酒的酒精含量太高，”他的母亲接着说，“这种蜜酒作饮料是不合适的，不过有人生了急病，它倒和红酒、白兰地一样地有效；所以，我把它收进我的药柜里去了。”
'We never drink spirits at this table, on principle,' added his father.
“我们吃饭是从来不喝酒的，这是规矩，”他的父亲补充说。
'But what shall I tell the dairyman's wife?' said Angel.
“但是我怎样对克里克太太说呢？”安琪尔说。
'The truth, of course,' said his father.
“当然实话实说，”他的父亲说。
'I rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the blackpuddings very much. She is a kind, jolly sort of body, and is sure to ask me directly I return.'
“我倒愿意对她说，我们非常喜欢她的蜜酒和血肠。她是那种友好、快活一类的人，我一回去，她肯定就要立即问我的。”
'You cannot, if we did not,' Mr Clare answered lucidly.
“既然我们没有吃，你就不能那样说，”克莱尔先生明明白白地说。
'AH - no; though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple.'
“啊——不那么说好了；不过那种蜜酒倒是值得一点一点品尝呢。”
'A what?' said Cuthbert and Felix both.
“你说什么呀？”卡斯伯特和费利克斯一齐问。
'Oh--'tis an expression they use down at Talbothays,' replied Angel, blushing. He felt that his parents were right in their practice if wrong in their want of sentiment, and said no more.
“哦——这是在泰波塞斯使用的说法，”安琪尔脸上一红，回答说。他觉得他的父母不近人情是不对的，但是他们的做法却是对的，所以就没有再说话。
Clare, restless, went out into the dusk when evening drew on, she who had won him having retired to her chamber.
傍晚来临的时候，坐立不安的克莱尔走出门外，来到苍茫的暮色里，而被他征服的她也已经回到了自己的房问。
The night was as sultry as the day. 
晚上还是和白天一样地闷热。
There was no coolness after dark unless on the grass. 
天黑以后，要是不到草地上去，就没有一丝凉气。
Roads, garden-paths, the house-fronts, the barton-walls were warm as hearths, and reflected the noontide temperature into the noctambulist's face.
道路、院中的小径、房屋正面的墙壁，还有院子的围墙，都热得像壁炉一样，而且还把正午的热气，反射到夜间行人的脸上。
He sat on the east gate of the dairy-yard, and knew not what to think of himself. 
他坐在奶牛场院子东边的栅栏门上，不知道怎样来看待自己。
Feeling had indeed smothered judgment that day.
白天，他的感情的确压倒了他的理智。
Since the sudden embrace, three hours before, the twain had kept apart. 
自从三个小时以前突然发生拥抱以来，他们两个人就再也没有在一块儿呆过。
She seemed stilled, almost alarmed, at what had occurred, while the novelty, unpremeditation, mastery of circumstance disquieted him - palpitating, contemplative being that he was. 
她似乎是对白天发生的事保持镇静，但实际上是几乎给吓坏了，他自己也因为这件事的新奇、不容思索和受环境支配的结果而惶惶不安起来，因为他是一个易于激动和爱好思索的人。
He could hardly realize their true relations to each other as yet, and what their mutual bearing should be before third parties thenceforward.
到目前为止，他还不大清楚他们两个人的真实关系，也不知道他们在其他人的面前应该怎样应付。
Angel had come as pupil to this dairy in the idea that his temporary existence here was to be the merest episode in his life, soon passed through and early forgotten; he had come as to a place from which as from a screened alcove he could calmly view the absorbing world without, and, apostrophizing it with Walt Whitman--
安琪尔来到这个奶牛场里当学徒，心想在这儿的短暂停留只不过是他人生中的一段插曲，不久就过去了，很快就忘掉了；他来到这儿，就像来到一个隐蔽的洞室，可以从里面冷静地观察外面吸引人的世界，并且同华尔特·惠特曼一起高喊—— 
Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, How curious you are to me!
你们这一群男女，身着日常的服饰，在我眼里是多么地新奇！
resolve upon a plan for plunging into that world anew. 
同时心里计划着，决心再重新进入到那个世界里去。
But, behold, the absorbing scene had been imported hither. 
但是你看，那吸引人的景象向这边转移过来了。
What had been the engrossing world had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumb-show; while here, in this apparently dim and un-impassioned place, novelty had volcanically started up, as it had never, for him, started up elsewhere.
曾经那样吸引人的世界，在外面又变成了一出索然无味的哑剧了；而在这个表面上沉闷和缺少激情的地方，新奇的东西却像火山一样喷发出来，这是他在其它地方从来没有见到过的。
This consciousness upon which he had intruded was the single opportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to Tess by an unsympathetic First Cause - her all; her every and only chance. 
他已经进入的这个知觉世界，是无情的造物主赐给苔丝的唯一的生存机会——是她的一切；是所有的也是仅有的机会。
To encounter her daily in the accustomed manner would be to develop what had begun. 
像过去的习惯那样天天和她见面，已经开了头的事情就会继续向前发展。
Living in such close relations, to meet meant to fall into endearment; flesh and blood could not resist it; and, having arrived at no conclusion as to the issue of such a tendency, he decided to hold aloof for the present from occupations in which they would be mutually engaged. 
他们的关系既然是这样亲密，见面就意味着相互温存；这是血肉之躯不能抗拒的；既然不知道这种趋向的发展会导致什么样的结果，他决定目前还是避开他们有可能共同参与的工作。
As yet the harm done was small. But it was not easy to carry out the resolution never to approach her. 
但是要坚持不同她接近的决心，却不是一件容易的事。
He was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse.
他的脉搏每跳动一次，都把他向她的身边推动一步。
He thought he would go and see his friends. 
他想他可以去看看他的朋友们。
It might be possible to sound them upon this. 
他可以就这件事听听他们的意见。
In less than five months his term here would have ended, and after a few additional months spent upon other farms he would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge, and in a position to start on his own account. 
在不到五个月的时间里，他在这儿学习的时间就要结束了，然后再到其它的农场上学习几个月，他就完全具备了从事农业的知识了；也就可以独立地创建自己的事业了。
Would not a farmer want a wife, and should a farmer's wife be a drawing-room wax-figure, or a woman who understood farming? 
一个农场主应不应该娶一个妻子？一个农场主的妻子应该是客厅里的蜡像呢，或者应该是一个懂得干农活的女人呢？
Notwithstanding the pleasing answer returned to him by the silence he resolved to go his journey.
不用说答案是他喜欢的那一种，尽管如此，他还是决定动身上路。
One morning when they sat down to breakfast at Talbothays Dairy some maid observed that she had not seen anything of Mr Clare that day.
有一天早晨，大家在泰波塞斯奶牛场坐下来吃饭的时候，有个姑娘注意到当天她没有看见克莱尔先生一点儿影子。
'O no,' said Dairyman Crick. 'Mr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster to spend a few days wi' his kinsfolk.'
“啊，不错，”奶牛场里的克里克老板说。“克莱尔先生已经回爱敏寺的家中去了，他要和他家里的人一起住几天。”
For four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the morning went out at a stroke, and the birds muffled their song. 
那张桌子上坐着四个情意绵缠的姑娘，对她们来说，那天早晨太阳的光芒突然黯淡无光了，鸟儿的啼鸣也变得嘶哑难听了。
But neither girl by word or gesture revealed her blankness.
但是没有一个姑娘用说话或者手势来表达她们的惆怅。
'He's getting on towards the end of his time wi' me,' added the dairyman, with a phlegm which unconsciously was brutal; 
“他在这儿跟我学习的时间就要结束了，”奶牛场老板接着说，他的话音里带着冷淡，却不知道这种冷淡就是残酷；
and so I suppose he is beginning to see about his plans elsewhere.
所以我想他已经开始考虑到其它地方去的计划了。
Clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times that he could reproduce them mentally with ease: 
克莱尔已经把她的两片嘴唇的曲线研究过许多次了，因此他在心里很容易就能够把它们再现出来；
and now, as they again confronted him, clothed with colour and life, they sent an aura over his flesh, a breeze through his nerves, which wellnigh produced a qualm; 
此刻它们就出现在他的面前，红红的嘴唇充满了生气，它们送过来一阵清风，吹过他的身体，这阵清风吹进了他的神经，几乎使他颤栗起来；
and actually produced, by some mysterious physiological process, a prosaic sneeze.
实在的情形是，由于某种神秘的生理过程，这阵清风让他打了一个毫无诗意的喷嚏。
She then became conscious that he was observing her; 
接着她意识到他正在看她；
but she would not show it by any change of position, though the curious dream-like fixity disappeared, and a close eye might easily have discerned that the rosiness of her face deepened, and then faded till only a tinge of it was left.
不过她表面上没有表现出来，坐着的姿势一点儿也没有动，但是她那种梦幻一样的沉思却消失了，只要仔细一看，很容易就能发现她脸上的玫瑰红色正在加深，后来又慢慢消褪了，上面只剩下一点淡淡的红色。
The influence that had passed into Clare like an excitation from the sky did not die down. 
克莱尔心中出现的那种好像从天而降的激动情绪，还没有消失。
Resolutions, reticences, prudences, fears, fell back like a defeated battalion. 
决心、沉默、谨慎、恐惧，好像一支打了败仗的军队，往后直退。
He lumped up from his seat, and, leaving his pail to be kicked over if the milcher had such a mind, went quickly towards the desire of his eyes, and, kneeling down beside her, clasped her in his arms.
他从座位上跳起来，把牛奶桶扔在那儿，也不管会不会被奶牛踢翻，三步并作两步地跑到他一心渴望的人跟前，跪在她的旁边，把她拥抱在自己怀里。
Tess was taken completely by surprise, and she yielded to his embrace with unreflecting inevitableness. 
苔丝冷不防地被吓了一跳，但是她想也没想，就不由自主地让他拥抱着自己。
Having seen that it was really her lover who had advanced, and no one else, her lips parted, and she sank upon him in her momentary joy, with something very like an ecstatic cry.
她看清了来到她面前的不是别人，确实是她所爱的人，就张开嘴发出一种近似狂喜的呼喊，带着暂时的欢愉倒在他的怀里。
He had been on the point of kissing that too tempting mouth, but he checked himself, for tender conscience' sake.
他正要去吻那张迷人的小嘴，但是由于他温柔的良知而克制住了自己。
'Forgive me, Tess dear!' he whispered. 
“原谅我，亲爱的苔丝！”他小声说。
I ought to have asked. 
我应该先问问你的。
I - did not know what I was doing.
我——我真不知道我正在干什么。
I do not mean it as a liberty. 
我不是有意冒犯你的。
I am devoted to you, Tessy, dearest, in all sincerity!'
我是真心爱你的，最亲爱的苔丝，我完全是一片真心啊！”
Old Pretty by this time had looked round, puzzled; 
这时候老美人回过头来看着他们，感到莫名其妙；
and seeing two people crouching under her where, by immemorial custom, there should have been only one, lifted her hind leg crossly.
它看见在它的肚子下面蜷伏着两个人，从它记事以来，那儿应该只有一个人的，于是发了脾气，抬了抬后腿。
'She is angry - she doesn't know what we mean - she'll kick over the milk!' exclaimed Tess, gently striving to free herself, her eyes concerned with the quadruped's actions, her heart more deeply concerned with herself and Clare.
“她生气了——她不懂我们在干什么——她会把牛奶桶踢翻的！”苔丝嘴里嚷着，一边轻轻地从克莱尔怀里挣脱出来，她的眼睛注意的是牛的动作，她的心里想的却是克莱尔和她自己。
She slipped up from her seat, and they stood together, his arm still encircling her. 
她从凳子上站起来，两人站在一起，克莱尔的胳膊仍然搂着她。
Tess's eyes, fixed on distance, began to fill.
苔丝的眼睛注视着远方，眼泪开始流了出来。
'Why do you cry, my darling?' he said.
“你为什么哭了，亲爱的？”他问。
'O - I don't know!' she murmured.
“啊——我不知道呀！”她嘟哝着说。
As she saw and felt more clearly the position she was in she became agitated and tried to withdraw.
等到她把自己的地位看清楚了，弄明白了，她就开始变得焦虑不安了，想从克莱尔的搂抱中挣脱出来。
'Well, I have betrayed my feeling, Tess, at last,' said he, with a curious sigh of desperation, signifying unconsciously that his heart had outrun his judgment. 
“啊，苔丝，我的真情终于流露出来了，”他说，奇怪地叹了一口气，这就在不知不觉中表明他的理智已经无法控制自己的感情了。
'That I - love you dearly and truly I need not say. But I - it shall go no further now - it distresses you - I am as surprised as you are. You will not think I have presumed upon your defencelessness - been too quick and unreflecting, will you?'
“我——我真心地爱你，真正地爱你，这是不用说的。可是我——现在不能再往前走了——这让你难过了——我也和你一样感到吃惊呢。你不会以为我在你没有防备时太鲁莽吧？——我来得太快，也没有想一想，你会不会？”
'N' - I can't tell.'
“不——我也说不清。”
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
“这样看来，一个女人家对自己的美貌也转不了多少念头喽。”
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
“不过，我的好老爷，彬格莱一搬到我们的邻近来，你的确应该去看看他。”
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
“老实跟你说吧，这不是我份内的事。”
But consider your daughters. 
看女儿的份上吧。
I desire you will do no such thing. 
我希望你别这么做。
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia. 
丽萃没有一点儿地方胜过别的几个女儿；我敢说，论漂亮，她抵不上吉英一半；论性子，好抵不上丽迪雅一半。
But you are always giving her the preference.
你可老是偏爱她。
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
“她们没有哪一个值得夸奖的，”他回答道；“他们跟人家的姑娘一样，又傻，又无知；倒是丽萃要比她的几个姐妹伶俐些。”
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves."
“我的好老爷，你怎么舍得这样糟蹋自己的新生亲生女儿？你是在故意叫我气恼，好让你自己得意吧。你半点儿也不体谅我的神经衰弱。”
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
“你真错怪了我，我的好太太。我非常尊重你的神经。它们是我的老朋友。至少在最近二十年以来，我一直听道你慎重其事地提到它们。”
"Ah! you do not know what I suffer."
“啊！你不知道我怎样受苦呢！”
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
“不过我希望你这毛病会好起来，那么，象这种每年有四千镑收入的阔少爷，你就可以眼看着他们一个个搬来做你的邻居了。”
"It will be no use to us if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
“你既然不愿意去拜访他们，即使有二十个搬了来，对我们又有什么好处！”
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty I will visit them all."
“放心吧，我的好太太，等到有了二十个，我一定去一个个拜望到。”
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. 
班纳特先生真是个古怪人，他一方面喜欢插科打浑，爱挖苦人，同时又不拘言笑，变幻莫测，真使他那位太太积二十三年之经验，还摸不透他的性格。
Her mind was less difficult to develope. 
太太的脑子是很容易加以分析的。
She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. 
她是个智力贫乏、不学无术、喜怒无常的女人，只要碰到不称心的事，她就以为神经衰弱。
The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.
她生平的大事就是嫁女儿；她生平的安慰就是访友拜客和打听新闻。
'Never mind that,' she coaxed. 
“不要你管我走不走得出去，”她哄着他说。
'Put me down, I beg you. I don't mind where it is; only let me get down, sir, please!'
“把我放下来，我求你了。我不管在什么地方；只请你让我下去，先生！”
She accepted these terms, and slid off on the near side, though not till he had stolen a cursory kiss. 
她接受了这些条件，就从马上溜了下来，不过还是让他偷偷地吻了一下。
He sprang down on the other side.
他也从另一边跳下马。
'I suppose I must hold the horse?' said she.
“我想我要牵着马吧？”她说。
'Oh no; it's not necessary,' replied Alec, patting the panting creature. 'He's had enough of it for to-night.'
“哦，不；用不着牵着马，”阿历克回答说，用手拍了拍那匹马。“今天晚上它可是受够了。”
He turned the horse's head into the bushes, hitched him on to a bough, and made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of dead leaves.
他把马牵到灌木丛那边，把它拴在一根树枝上，又在一大堆厚厚的枯树叶中间，给她弄了一个床或是窝什么的。
'Now, you sit there,' he said. 
“好啦，你坐在这儿吧，”他说。
The leaves have not got damp as yet. 
这些树叶还没有给雾气弄湿。
Just give an eye to the horse - it will be quite sufficient.'
稍微注意一下马——稍微注意一下就足够了。”
He took a few steps away from her, but, returning, said, 'By the bye, Tess, your father has a new cob to-day. Somebody gave it to him.'
他往前走了几步，但是他又转过身来说，“顺便告诉你，苔丝，今天你父亲得了一匹新马。有个人送给他的。”
'Somebody? You!'
“有人？是你！”
D'Urberville nodded.
德贝维尔点点头。
'O how very good of you that is!' she exclaimed, with a painful sense of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then.
“啊，那你真是太好了！”她嚷着说，但是又因为正好要在这个时候感谢他，心里觉得难过。
And the children have some toys.'
“孩子们也得了一些玩具。”
'I didn't know - you ever sent them anything!' she murmured, much moved. 'I almost wish you had not - yes, I almost wish it!'
“我不知道——你给他们送了东西！”她低声说，心里很感动。“我真希望你没有送东西——是的，我一直是这样希望的！”
'Why, dear?'
“为什么，亲爱的？”
'It - hampers me so.'
“这——使我太为难了。”
'Tessy - don't you love me ever so little now?'
“苔丝——到现在你还是一点儿不爱我吗？”
He touched her with his fingers, which sank into her as into down. 
他用手指去摸她，手指头按进内里，感到像绒毛一样柔软。
'You have only that puffy muslin dress on - how's that?'
“你只穿了一件薄薄的棉布衣服——这怎么办呢？”
'It's my best summer one. 'Twas very warm when I started, and I didn't know I was going to ride, and that it would be night.'
“这是我夏天穿的最好一件衣服。我出门时穿着它很暖和，我哪儿知道要骑着马走路，哪儿知道要走到深夜呢。”

Preamble
序言
Macao, including the Macao Peninsula, Taipa Island and Coloane Island, has been part of the territory of China since ancient times; it was gradually occupied by Portugal after the mid-16th century. 
澳门，包括澳门半岛、凼仔岛和路环岛，自古以来就是中国的领土，十六世纪中叶以后被葡萄牙逐步占领。
On April 13, 1987, the Chinese and Portuguese Governments signed the Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao, affirming that the Government of the People's Republic of China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao with effect from December 20, 1999, thus fulfilling the long-cherished common aspiration of the Chinese people for the recovery of Macao.
一九八七年四月十三日，中葡两国政府签署了关于澳门问题的联合声明，确认中华人民共和国政府于一九九九年十二月二十日恢复对澳门行使主权，从而实现了长期以来中国人民收回澳门的共同愿望。
Upholding national unity and territorial integrity, contributing to social stability and economic development, and taking account of its history and realities, the People's Republic of China has decided that, upon China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Macao, a Macao Special Administrative Region will be established in accordance with the provisions of Article 31 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and that under the principle of "one country, two systems," the socialist system and policies will not be practiced in Macao.
为了维护国家的统一和领土完整，有利于澳门的社会稳定和经济发展，考虑到澳门的历史和现实情况，国家决定，在对澳门恢复行使主权时，根据中华人民共和国宪法第三十一条的规定，设立澳门特别行政区，并按照“一个国家，两种制度”的方针，不在澳门实行社会主义的制度和政策。
The basic policies of the People's Republic of China regarding Macao have been elaborated by the Chinese Government in the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration. 
国家对澳门的基本方针政策，已由中国政府在中葡联合声明中予以阐明。
In accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the National People's Congress hereby enacts the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, prescribing the systems to be practiced in the Macao Special Administrative Region, in order to ensure the implementation of the basic policies of the People's Republic of China regarding Macao. 
根据中华人民共和国宪法，全国人民代表大会特制定中华人民共和国澳门特别行政区基本法，规定澳门特别行政区实行的制度，以保障国家对澳门的基本方针政策的实施。

因为你所能做的是将你的问题 转变成一个其他人已经解决的问题，并运用他们的解决方法。
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami.
而我想要告诉你们，我们是如何在折纸术中做到这一点的。
Origami revolves around crease patterns.
折纸术是围绕折痕图进行的。
The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure.
这个折痕图就是一个折纸造型 的设计图
And you can't just draw them arbitrarily.
设计图可不能随便画。
They have to obey four simple laws.
它们必须遵循4个简单的规则。
And they're very simple, easy to understand.
它们非常简单，并且很好理解。
The first law is two-colorability. 
第一个规则是双可着色性。
You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting.
你可以用两种颜色 填充你想画的的折痕图而 相同的颜色不会相邻。
The directions of the folds at any vertex --the number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds --always differs by two. 
在任何顶点的折叠方向--凸折法的数量，凹折法的数量--之间总是相差两下。
Two more or two less.
多折或少折两下。
Nothing else.
就这么简单。
If you look at the angles around the fold, you find that if you number the angles in a circle, all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line.
如果观察折痕周围的角，你会发现在数围成一圈的角时，所有列为偶数的角加起来是一条直线。
All the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.
所有列为奇数的角加起来是一个直线。
And if you look at how the layers stack, you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets, a sheet can never penetrate a fold.
接下来，如果观察这些纸是怎么叠加起来的，你会发现不论怎样叠加褶层和纸片，纸片永远不能 穿透褶层。
So that's four simple laws. 
这就是四则简单的规则。
That's all you need in origami.
在折纸艺术中这就是全部。
All of origami comes from that.
所有的折纸都源于这些。
And you'd think, "Can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity?"
现在你觉得：“那些复杂的工艺 能是从四则简单的规则中衍生出来的吗？”
But indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin, and yet they govern all of chemistry, all of life, all of history.
但是，事实上，量子力学的法则可以在一张餐巾纸上写出来。 而它们可以支配所有的化学， 甚至生活和历史的全部。
If we obey these laws, we can do amazing things.
如果遵循这些规则，我们能做出令人吃惊的事。
So in origami, to obey these laws, we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures -- and by itself it's nothing.
所以折纸时，在遵循这些规则的情况下，我们可以做出简单的样式--比如这个重复的折叠样式，叫做纹理--虽然这样单独看起来很普通。
But if we follow the laws of origami, we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very, very simple, but when we put it together, we get something a little different.
但如果我们遵守折纸的规则，我们能把这些样式加入另一种折法，这种折法本身非常非常的简单。但当我们把它加进来，会得到很不一样的东西。
This fish, 400 scales -- again, it is one uncut square, only folding.
这条鱼有400片鱼鳞，同样，它是一张没被剪过的正方形纸张。
And if you don't want to fold 400 scales, you can back off and just do a few things, and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.
如果你不想折400片鱼鳞，你可以退而求其次，做些简单的折叠得到一只乌龟的背壳或脚趾。
Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars on a flag, with 13 stripes.
或者可以提升成为一面拥有50颗星星和13条横条的旗子（美国国旗）。
And if you want to go really crazy, 1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.
如果你想做些疯狂的事情，这有一条有1000片鳞片的响尾蛇。
And this guy's on display downstairs, so take a look if you get a chance.
这个作品展示在楼下，所以你们有机会可以看看。
The most powerful tools in origami have related to how we get parts of creatures.
在折纸艺术中，最有用的方法和我们怎样构造生物的一部分有关。
And I can put it in this simple equation.
我可以用一个简单的等式来解释。
We take an idea, combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.
我们产生了一个想法， 把它与张纸片结合，就能得到一个折纸作品。
What matters is what we mean by those symbols.
重要的是这些符号代表什么。
And you might say, "Can you really be that specific?
你们可能会问：“真的能做到那么具体吗？
I mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws, it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?"
我是说一只鹿角虫有两个点状的嘴，和触角。你真的能做到具体到细节吗？”
And yeah, you really can.
是的，真的可以。
So how do we do that? 
那该怎么做呢？
Well, we break it down into a few smaller steps.
我们把它分成几个小步骤。
So let me stretch out that equation.
为此，让我来展开这个等式。
I start with my idea. I abstract it.
我先从我的构思开始，使它抽象化。
What's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.
什么是最抽象的形式呢？线条画。
And from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject.
然后从这个线条画，我得用某种方式得到折叠的式样， 并且包括想要表现对象的所有部分。
A flap for every leg.
一片三角形折叠对应一条腿。
And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base, you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them, you can turn it into the finished shape.
然后，我们称这个折叠的式样为基础。 你可以使它的腿变细，使其弯曲， 你可以把它做成成品。
Now the first step: pretty easy.
第一步：很简单。
Take an idea, draw a stick figure.
做出一个构思，画一幅线条图。
The last step is not so hard, but that middle step -- going from the abstract description to the folded shape -- that's hard.
最后一步也不是很难，但中间的一步--把抽象的描绘变为折叠的式样--这很难。
But that's the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump.
但就是在这，数学理论让我们 翻越难关。
And I'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something.
我要向你们展示怎样做，这样离开这里后，你们可以叠出些东西。
But we're going to start small.
但我们要先从小的开始。
This base has a lot of flaps in it.
这个基础有很多片状物。
We're going to learn how to make one flap.
我们要学习怎样做一个片状物。
How would you make a single flap?
你会怎样叠一个片状物呢？
Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again, until it gets long and narrow, and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.
拿一张正方形的纸，把它对折再对折，直到它变得又长又细，然后这个的尾部就是一个片状物。
I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.
我能用它做一条腿，一只手臂，和所有相似的东西。
What paper went into that flap?
在片状物中是什么样的纸呢？
Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern, you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap.
如果把它展开去看它的折痕图，你们可以看到在纸片的左上角的形状就是构成片状物的纸。
So that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over.
所以那就是一个片状物，和所有剩下的纸。
I can use it for something else.
我可以用剩下的部分做点别的。
Well, there's other ways of making a flap.
也有另外的做片状物的方法。
There's other dimensions for flaps.
也有不同形状的片状物。
If I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper.
如果把片状物叠得更细一些，所用的纸会更少。
If I make the flap as skinny as possible, I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.
如果把片状物尽可能的叠细，就能只用片状物所需的最少的纸。
And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.
就像你们所看到的，只需要纸上四分之一个圆就可以作出一个片状物。
There's other ways of making flaps.
还有别的做片状物的方法。
If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.
如果把片状物放在纸片边上，就需要一个半圆的纸。
And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.
如果把片状物放在纸片的中心，就需要一整圆。
So no matter how I make a flap, it needs some part of a circular region of paper.
就是说不论怎样叠，片状物是由纸上圆形区域的一部分做成的。
So now we're ready to scale up.
现在让我们来提升到新的水平。
What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?
如果要叠一个有很多片状物的东西该怎么办呢？
What do I need? 
我需要什么？
I need a lot of circles.
我需要很多的圆。
And in the 1990s, origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles.
在二十世纪九十年代，折纸艺术家发现了这些规则，并了解到我们可以通过组合圆形 来叠出任意复杂的形状。
And here's where the dead people start to help us out.
这就是那些死去的人能帮到我们的地方。
Because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles.
因为很多人都研究过组合圆形的问题。
I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements.
我可以依赖那些有关圆的组合和排列的大量的数学与艺术的历史。
And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.
然后我可以用这些式样来制造折纸的形状。
So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles, you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules. 
我们可以依据这些规则来组合圆形，依据更多的规矩我们可以用线条来装饰圆。
That gives you the folds.
这就有了折叠线。
Those folds fold into a base. 
沿这些线折叠就可以得到大体形状。
You shape the base.
你们就做出了大体的形状。
You get a folded shape -- in this case, a cockroach.
你们得到一个折叠的形状，在这里，是一只蟑螂。
And it's so simple.
而且它非常的简单。
It's so simple that a computer could do it.
因为它很简单，电脑就可以把它做出来。
And you say, "Well, you know, how simple is that?"
你们可能问“那能有多简单呢？”
But computers, you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms, and with this we could.
但是要用电脑，你们需要用最基本的方法来描述一件事物。而这里我们可以做到。
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.
所以我在很多年前写了一个电脑程序， 叫做TreeMaker(造树者），你们可以在我的网页上下载它。
It's free. 
它是免费的。
It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.
它可以在大部分的操作系统里面运行，甚至在Windows里。
And you just draw a stick figure, and it calculates the crease pattern.
然后你们就可以自己画一个线条图， 这个程序会根据线条图计算折痕。
It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern, and if you use that stick figure that I just showed, which you can kind of tell -- it's a deer, it's got antlers -- you'll get this crease pattern.
这个程序可以排列圆形，计算折痕，还有如果你们用刚才我展示的线条图，你们可以看出它是一只有角的鹿，你们就可以得到这个折痕图。
And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines, you'll get a base that you can then shape into a deer, with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.
用这个折痕图，折叠有虚线的地方，你们就能得到一个基础，然后再用你们想用的方法 叠出一只鹿。
And if you want a different deer, not a white-tailed deer, you change the packing, and you can do an elk.
如果你们想要一只不同种的鹿，而不是白尾鹿，你们可以改变圆形的排列，然后得到一只麋鹿。
Or you could do a moose.
或是一只驼鹿。
Or really, any other kind of deer.
或是其它任何一种鹿。
These techniques revolutionized this art.
这些技术改革了这门艺术。
We found we could do insects, spiders, which are close -- things with legs, things with legs and wings, things with legs and antennae.
我们发现我们可以叠出昆虫，或是相近的蜘蛛，有脚的东西，有脚和翅膀的东西，和有脚和触角的东西。
And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn't interesting enough, then you could do two praying mantises from a single uncut square.
如果用一张没剪过的正方形纸叠一只螳螂还不够有趣的话，你们可以用一张没剪过的正方形纸叠两只螳螂。
She's eating him.
她在吃他。
I call it "Snack Time."
我称之为“点心时间”。
And you can do more than just insects.
你们能做的不只是昆虫。
This -- you can put details: toes and claws. 
你们可以把它做到有细节， 像指头和爪子。
A grizzly bear has claws.
一只有爪子的北美洲灰熊。
This tree frog has toes.
和这只有脚趾的树蛙。
Actually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.
实际上，在折纸艺术中有很多人把指头加入到他们的模型中。
Toes have become an origami meme.
指头变成了折纸艺术的文化基因。
Because everyone's doing it.
因为每个人都在做。
You can make multiple subjects.
你可以做出多种的物体。
So these are a couple of instrumentalists.
像这里有一些音乐家。
The guitar player from a single square, the bass player from a single square.
一个正方形做出的吉他手。 一个正方形做出的贝斯手。
And if you say, "Well, but the guitar, bass -- that's not so hot.
如果你说，“好吧，但吉他和贝斯不够帅。
Do a little more complicated instrument."
做些更复杂的乐器吧。”
Well, then you could do an organ.
那你可以做一架风琴。
And what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand.
所以在这个世界里我们能做出所需要的创造。
So now people can say, I want exactly this and this and this, and you can go out and fold it.
如果现在有人说，我想要这个这个还有这个。你就可以精确的把它们叠出来。
And sometimes you create high art, and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.
有时可以做纯艺术。有时可以做些商品卖钱。
But I want to show you some examples.
但是我想给你们看一些例子。
Everything you'll see here, except the car, is origami.
除了车子， 你们将看到的所有东西都是折纸。
Just to show you, this really was folded paper.
就是想展示给你们这些真实的折纸。
Computers made things move, but these were all real folded objects that we made.
电脑使所有的东西动起来。 但是这些折纸全都是货真价实的。
And we can use this not just for visuals, but it turns out to be useful even in the real world.
我们不只可以在视觉上运用到折纸艺术，它实际上在现实世界中也很有用。
Surprisingly, origami, and the structures that we've developed in origami, turn out to have applications in medicine, in science, in space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.
令人惊奇的，折纸 和从折纸中发展出来的结构可以在医药学，科学，太空，身体和电子产品等等上得到应用。
And I want to show you some of these examples.
我想展示一些例子。
One of the earliest was this pattern: this folded pattern, studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.
在最早的应用中有这样一个样式，折纸样式，由日本的工程师Koryo Miura发明的。
He studied a folding pattern, and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure.
他研究这个折纸样式，然后发现可以折出很紧凑的包装，有很简单的开口和闭合结构。
And he used it to design this solar array.
他应用这个技术设计了这个太阳能电池板。
It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope in 1995.
这是一个艺术家的表演，但它在1995应用到了一架日本望远镜。
Now, there is actually a little origami in the James Webb space telescope, but it's very simple.
现在在詹姆斯韦伯太空望远镜中只有一点点的折纸艺术，但它十分之简单。
The telescope -- going up in space, it unfolds in two places.
这架进入太空的望远镜在两处展开。
It folds in thirds. 
它在第三个处折叠。
It's a very simple pattern -- you wouldn't even call that origami.
它是一个很简单的式样，你都不会把它称作折纸。
They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.
这些科学家的确不用跟折纸艺术家讨论。
But if you want to go higher and go larger than this, then you might need some origami.
但当你要更深入的研究时，折纸术是必需的。
Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger.
劳伦斯利物穆尔国家实验室的工程师们有一个关于一个更大的望远镜的构想。
They called it "The Eyeglass."
他们称之为“镜片”。
The design called for geosynchronous orbit, 26,000 miles up, 100-meter diameter lens.
这个设计需要同步轨道，高于地面26000英里，和直径100米的镜片。
So, imagine a lens the size of a football field.
所以镜片有一个橄榄球场那么大。
There were two groups of people who were interested in this: planetary scientists who want to look up, and then other people who wanted to look down.
有两类人对这个望远镜有兴趣：想要观察太空的行星学家，和其他想要观察地球的人。
Whether you look up or look down, how do you get it up in space? 
不论你想观察什么， 该怎么上太空呢？
You've got to get it up there in a rocket.
你需要一个火箭。
And rockets are small. 
而且火箭一般都很小。
So you have to make it smaller.
所以你需要把望远镜做的小一些。
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?
怎么把一大片玻璃变小呢？
Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.
唯一的办法就是折叠。
So you have to do something like this -- this was a small model.
所以你要做这样的事，这一个小型的模型。
For the lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures.
对于镜片，你把板面分区然后加上弯曲。
But this pattern's not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters.
但是这个样式不能把100米的东西变成几米。
So the Livermore engineers, wanting to make use of the work of dead people, or perhaps live origamists, said, "Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing."
所以利物穆尔的工程师们，想要利用那些死去的人的成果，或是活着的折纸艺术家的成果。工程师们说“看看有没有别人在做这类事。”
So they looked into the origami community, we got in touch with them, and I started working with them.
所以他们研究折纸圈。 我们和折纸艺术家取得联系，而我开始和他们一起工作。
And we developed a pattern together that scales to arbitrarily large size, but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.
我们一起开发了一个 可以应用到任意大小， 但可以允许所有的平面环或圆盘 折成一个整洁紧凑的圆柱体的样式。
And they adopted that for their first generation, which was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter.
他们在第一代的望远镜中采用了这个样式。而第一代并不是100米而是5米。
But this is a five-meter telescope -- has about a quarter-mile focal length.
但是这个5米的望远镜有0.25英里的焦距。
And it works perfectly on its test range, and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.
而且在它的测试范围内效果很好。它也的确被叠成了一小捆。
Now, there is other origami in space.
现在，还有别的折纸术应用到太空中。
The problem that's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination, but needs to be small for the journey.
在这里所被解决的问题是做出了一个在旅途中很小 但在目的地很大的薄片状的物体。
And that works whether you're going into space, or whether you're just going into a body.
这个可以作用于当你想进入太空，或是想进入人的身体时。
And this example is the latter.
这个例子就是进入人身体的。
This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University.
这是由牛津大学的钟游发明的心脏手术支架。
It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination, but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there, through your blood vessels.
它在到达目的地时会打开被堵塞的动脉血管。但在旅途中它需要变得很小才能通过你的血管。
And this stent folds down using an origami pattern, based on a model called the water-bomb base.
这个支架运用一种折纸术被叠小。我们称这个模型为水弹模型。
Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space.
安全气囊的设计师也遇到了同样的把大薄片塞进小空间里的问题。
And they want to do their design by simulation.
而且他们都是通过仿真技术来做设计。
So they need to figure out how, in a computer, to flatten an airbag.
所以他们需要在电脑里研究出怎样使安全气囊变平。
And the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation.
我们所开发出的叠昆虫的算法在这里变成了在仿真技术中解决安全气囊问题的方法。
And so they can do a simulation like this.
所以设计师可以做一个这个的模仿。
Those are the origami creases forming, and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out: does it work?
那些就是折纸的折痕，现在你们所看到的就是正在放气的安全气囊并且大家可以知道这方法管不管用。
And that leads to a really interesting idea.
这个例子实际上可以推导出一个十分有趣的构想。
You know, where did these things come from?
你们知道，这些发明设计都是从哪来么？
Well, the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school.
这个心脏手术支架是从大家小学就学到的纸气球中衍生来的。
It's the same pattern, called "the water-bomb base."
它们有着相同的构造，称之为“水弹模型”。
The airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects -- things with legs.
那个使安全气囊变平的算法是从那些实际上只是发明出来用来叠昆虫，也就是有腿的东西，的数学理论。
The thing is, that this often happens in math and science.
其实呢，这样的事经常发生在数学和科学里面。
When you get math involved, problems that you solve for aesthetic value only, or to create something beautiful, turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world.
当你运用数学，解决你纯粹为了美学价值或是创造美而想解决的问题时，实际上结果反过来在现实世界中也可以应用。
And as weird and surprising as it may sound, origami may someday even save a life.
而且即使听上去很奇怪，折纸术有一天可能会救人一命。
Let's start with day and night.
让我们从日夜开始。
Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness, light and then darkness.
生命的进化在光明与黑暗中进行，光明，然后是黑暗。
And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light.
因此植物和动物都进化出自己的内部时钟，这使得他们能适应光线的改变。
These are chemical clocks, and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell.
这是化学时钟，每个已知的多细胞生物体内都有这种时钟，部分单细胞生物也有这种时钟。
I'll give you an example.
举个例子。
If you take a horseshoe crab off the beach, and you fly it all the way across the continent, and you drop it into a sloped cage, it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores, and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away.
如果你从海滩上抓一只鲎，把它空运到大陆的另一端，接着把它放入一个倾斜的笼子里，在它数千里外家乡的海岸涨潮的时候，它会爬到笼子的高处。而退潮时它又会退回笼子底部。
It'll do this for weeks, until it kind of gradually loses the plot.
这种行为它会重复数个星期， 直到它渐渐失去这种判断能力。
And it's incredible to watch, but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on; it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it.
这非常不可思议， 但这不是什么灵异或是超自然现象； 原因很简单，这些鲎拥有 能与周围环境相协调的内部周期。
So, we have this ability as well.
我们也有这种能力。
And in humans, we call it the body clock.
就人类而言，我们称之为生物钟。
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground, for a couple of months.
当你拿走某个人的手表，把他关进一个深入地下的地下堡垒关上几个月，你就能更清楚地观察到生物钟的作用。
People actually volunteer for this, and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole.
实际上有志愿者做过这个实验， 他们从洞里出来时 对他们在洞里的时间有点混乱。
So, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be, they all show the same thing.
不管这些志愿者显得多不合逻辑，有一件事可以确认。
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks.
他们每天都比之前晚起一点--大约15分钟左右--在这几星期内他们的生物钟就像这样不断向后推延。
And so, in this way, we know that they are working on their own internal clocks, rather than somehow sensing the day outside.
而且，就这样，我们知道他们是用自己的生物钟做到这点的， 而不是用某种方式感知外面的日光。
So fine, we have a body clock, and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.
那么好的，我们有生物钟，并且它对我们的生活极其重要。
It's a huge driver for culture, and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.
它也是文化的巨大推动力，我认为这是在我们的行为中最被低估的一种力量。
We evolved as a species near the equator, and so we're very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness.
我们人类是从赤道附近进化而来的一个物种，因此我们能非常好的适应12小时的白昼和12小时的黑夜。
But of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe, and in Arctic Canada, where I live, we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter.
不过当然，我们现在已经遍布全球的每个角落，在我居住的加拿大北极地区，夏天是极昼， 而冬天则是极夜。
So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture, traditionally has been highly seasonal.
因此传统上北部原住民文化是高度季节性的。
In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on.
在冬天，睡眠时间很长。
You enjoy your family life inside.
人们在室内享受家庭生活。
And in summer, it's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours, very active.
而在夏天则是疯狂的狩猎及很长时间的劳作， 非常活跃。
So, what would our natural rhythm look like?
那么，我们的自然节奏应该是什么样的呢？
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense?
我们的理想中的睡眠模式应是什么样的呢？
Well, it turns out that, when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all, they sleep twice every night.
嗯，事实表明，当生活在完全没有 任何人工光源的环境中时，人们会每晚睡两次。
They go to bed around 8:00 pm.
人们在晚上8点左右睡觉。
until midnight and then again, they sleep from about 2:00 am until sunrise.
直到午夜，接着再次入睡，大约从凌晨2点直到日出。
And in-between, they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed.
在这两次睡眠之间，有几个小时在床上安静的沉思。
And during this time, there's a surge of prolactin, the likes of which a modern day never sees.
在这段时间内， 催乳素产生 这样的情况在现代社会不会出现。
The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime, that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives.
这些研究中的人们 在白天觉得很清醒， 他们意识到正在经历生命中的 第一次真正的失眠。
So, cut to the modern day.
那么，转到现代社会。
We're living in a culture of jet lag, global travel, 24-hour business, shift work.
我们的文化中充满时差，全球旅行，24小时营业，倒班工作。
And, you know, our modern ways of doing things have their advantages, but I believe we should understand the costs.
你知道，我们现代人的这种生活方式有它的优点，但我想我们应该明白所付出的代价。
It can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.
海洋是一个非常复杂的事物。
And it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.
人类的健康也是一件非常复杂的事情。
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task.
将两者统一起来看起来是一件艰巨的任务。
But what I'm going to try to say is that even in that complexity, there's some simple themes that I think, if we understand, we can really move forward.
但我想要试图去说明的是即使是如此复杂的情况，也存在一些我认为简单的话题，一些如果我们能理解，就很容易向前发展的话题。
And those simple themes aren't really themes about the complex science of what's going on, but things that we all pretty well know.
这些简单的话题确实不是有关那复杂的科学有了怎样的发展，而是一些我们都恰好知道的事情。
And I'm going to start with this one.
接下来我就来说一个。
If momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
如果老妈不高兴了，大家都别想开心。
We know that, right? We've experienced that.
我们都知道，不是吗？我们都经历过。
And if we just take that and we build from there, then we can go to the next step, which is that if the ocean ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
接下来如果我们能理解这一点 从这里出发， 可以得出下一步的， 那就是如果海洋不高兴了 大家也都别想开心。
That's the theme of my Talk.
这就是我演讲的主题。
And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.
我们正在通过许多不同的方法惹怒海洋。
This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.
这是1932年在坎纳里鲁夫拍的一副照片
Cannery Row, at the time, had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast.
那时的坎纳里鲁夫，有着西海岸最大的工业化罐头工厂。
We piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water.
我们堆积了大量的污染物在空气中和水中
Rolf Bolin, who was a professor at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work, wrote in the 1940s that, "The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead-based paints black."
我所工作的霍普金的海洋研究站的 罗尔夫·博林教授， 在二十世纪40年代指出，“海湾入口里浮沫所散发的臭气 特别难闻 那里有含铅的黑涂料。
People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell.
工作在罐头厂的人们 每天都只能待在这样的气味之中。
But you know what they came out saying?
然而你知道他们说什么吗？
They say, "You know what you smell?
他们说：“你知道你闻到的是什么吗？
You smell money."
你闻到的是钱的气味。”
That pollution was money to that community.
污染来自于社区的金钱利益。
And those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money.
那些人们和污染生活在一起 并把污染吸入了它们的皮肤和身体 因为他们需要钱。
We made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy, and we made them unhealthy.
让海洋不高兴，人们也特别不高兴， 并且人类还不再健康。
The connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages.
海洋的健康和人类健康之间的联系 确实就像另一组谚语说的那样。
And I want to call that "pinch a minnow, hurt a whale."
我觉得这么说： “抓了小鱼，害死鲸鱼”
The pyramid of ocean life ...
海洋生物的食物链……
Now ... when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way, and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean.
现在……当一位生态学者看待海洋的时候——我承认—— 我们用一种十分不同的方式来看待海洋， 比起普通人，我们看待海洋时发现的不同之处更多。
Because when an ecologist looks at the ocean, we see all those interconnections.
因为当生态学家看待海洋的时候，会看到其中的相互联系。
We see the base of the food chain, the plankton the small things, and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid, and on so up this diagram.
我们看食物链的下层，浮游生物这种小东西，还会看这些小动物们是如何成为位于金字塔中部动物们的食物的，然后就这样一直向上走到这幅图的顶部。
And that flow, that flow of life, from the very base up to the very top, is the flow that ecologists see.
这种生命的流动 从最底部流向最顶部， 是生态学家们关注的。
And that's what we're trying to preserve when we say, "Save the ocean. Heal the ocean."
并且这就是我们努力去保护的 当我们说：“救救海洋，给海洋治治病吧。”
It's that pyramid.
说的就是这金字塔。
Now why does that matter for human health?
那么为什么这与人类的健康有关系呢？
Because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn't be there, some very frightening things happen.
因为，当我们把一些本不该在食物链底部存在 的东西塞进了金字塔食物链之后， 就出现了很可怕的事情。
Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us, molecules like PCBs that can't be broken down by our bodies.
一些由我们制造的污染物，像是PCB分子（多氯联苯，一种致癌物质）是不能被我们的身体吸收的。
And they go in the base of that pyramid, and they drift up, they're passed up that way, on to predators and on to the top predators.
它们进入到食物链金字塔的底部，并不断向上，经过食物链，到达肉食动物和顶端肉食动物这里。
And in so doing, they accumulate.
这样的话，就堆积起来了。
Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.
然后，为了能彻底了解这个问题，我想邀请大家做个小游戏
We don't really have to play it. We can just think about it here.
我们并不是真的要玩，只是在这里想一下就好。
It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.
这是个保丽龙发泡胶和巧克力的游戏。
Imagine that when we got on this boat, we were all given two Styrofoam peanuts.
想象一下当我们登上这艘船， 我们都得到了 两个保丽龙的花生。
Can't do much with them but put them in your pocket.
除了把它们放在兜里，你也做不了什么其他的。
Because the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink, you give them the drink, and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too.
因为规则是：每一次你请别人喝一杯的时候， 除了要给别人酒之外， 也要把你的保丽龙花生给别人。
What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here.
接下来发生的事情就是保丽龙花生 会开始在我们的团体里流通。
And they will accumulate in the drunkest stingiest people.
并且它们会集中在 最吝啬的醉鬼身上
There's no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts.
这个游戏里面的机制 让人们什么也做不了 除了得到越来越大的一堆 无法消化的保丽龙花生。
And that's exactly what happens with PDBs in this food pyramid.
这就是和PDB分子（对二氯苯，化学合成药剂，致癌） 在食物链中的堆积一样。
They accumulate into the top of it.
它们富集在食物链的顶部。
Now suppose instead of Styrofoam peanuts, we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead.
然后假设不用保丽龙花生， 我们用这些可爱的巧克力 来替代它们。
Well, some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around.
嗯，我们之中的一些人会把巧克力吃了 而不给别人。
And instead of accumulating, they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group.
这样就不会产生堆积， 它们只会在人群中流通 但不会堆积在人群里。
Because they're absorbed by us.
因为巧克力可以被我们吸收。
And that's the difference between a PCB and, say, something natural like an omega-3, something we want out of the marine food chain.
这与PCB分子是不同的，可以说，就像ω-3脂肪酸一样天然，我们希望海洋食物链里有这些东西。
PCBs accumulate.
PCB的富集。
We have great examples of that, unfortunately.
很不幸，有许多这种例子
PCBs accumulate in dolphins in Sarasota Bay, in Texas, in North Carolina.
PCB堆积在海豚体内 就发生在萨拉索塔湾，得克萨斯州，北卡罗来纳州。
They get into the food chain.
PCB分子进入了食物链。
The dolphins eat the fish that have PCBs from the plankton, and those PCBs, being fat-soluble, accumulate in these dolphins.
海豚吃了小鱼 小鱼从浮游生物那里得到了PCB分子， 这些脂溶性的PCB分子 就富集在了海豚体内。
Now, a dolphin, mother dolphin, any dolphin -- there's only one way that a PCB can get out of a dolphin.
现在，一只海豚， 海豚母亲，或者是任何的海豚 只有一种方法 排出PCB分子。
And what's that?
是什么呢？
In mother's milk.
通过母乳。
Here's a diagram of the PCB load of dolphins in Sarasota bay.
这是一张萨拉索塔湾海豚 体内PCB含量的图表。
Adult males, a huge load.
成年雄性体内的含量巨大。
Juveniles, a huge load.
幼年海豚体内也有很大含量。
Females after their first calf is already weaned, a lower load.
雌性在第一次哺乳期之后 含量稍低。
Those females, they're not trying to.
雌性海豚并不想这样。
Those females are passing the PCBs in the fat of their own mother's milk into their offspring.
它们将PCB分子 通过乳汁里面的脂肪 传递给了它们的后代。
And their offspring don't survive.
而后代没有活下来。
The death rate in these in these dolphins, for the first calf born of every female dolphin, is 60 to 80 percent.
这些海豚的死亡率， 每只雌性海豚的第一胎， 大约在60%到80％。
These mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant.
母亲们把污染物 都输送给了第一胎后代。
And most of them die.
其中大部分都会死去。
Now, the mother then can go and reproduce, but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals -- the death of the first born calf.
现在，雌性海豚可以继续繁殖了， 但这代价太大了 污染物富集在 这些动物体内 ——这要由第一胎后代的死来买单。
There's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out.
原来，在海洋食物链里还有另外一个顶端捕食者
That top predator, of course, is us.
显然，这个顶端捕食者就是我们。
And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places.
我们也吃肉 来自于同样一些地方的肉。
This is whale meat that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo -- or is it?
这是鲸鱼肉 我在东京一家食品店拍到的 或者不是？
In fact, what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were.
实际上，我们做了几年的研究 研究如何偷运 一所分子生物实验室进东京 用于遗传学的检验 检验鲸鱼肉中去出的DNA样本 并鉴定它们到底是什么。
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.
一部分鲸鱼肉样本确实是鲸鱼肉。
Some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.
顺带一说，另一部分检验出不合规格。
That's another story.
这是另一个话题了。
But some of them were not whale meat at all.
但是有一些就根本不是鲸鱼肉。
Even though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.
即使有着鲸鱼肉的幌子，实际上这些是海豚肉。
Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber.
有一些是海豚肝脏。有一些是海豚的鳍。
And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs, dioxins and heavy metals.
那些海豚肉 都含巨量的PCB分子， 二恶英（剧毒）和重金属。
And that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat.
这些有害物质都流入到 食用这些肉的人身体内。
It turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world.
这证明许多海豚 在世界上的鲸肉市场里 都被当作肉食出售。
That's a tragedy for those populations.
对海豚来说这是一场悲剧。
But it's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don't know that that's toxic meat.
但对食用它们的人类来说 同样是一场悲剧 因为他们并不知道这是有毒的肉。
We had these data a few years ago.
几年前的一天我们得出的这些数据。
I remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.
我记得我坐在办公桌旁 作为世界上唯一的人 唯一知道在鲸鱼肉市场上卖的那些鲸鱼肉 实际上是海豚肉,并且含毒的人。
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the EPA.
含有的毒素是有史以来环保局允许的 2-3倍到400倍。
And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking, "Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery."
并且我记得我坐在办公桌之前想： “嗯，我发现了这个，这是个伟大的科学发现。”
But it was so awful.
但它如此可怕。
And for the very first time in my scientific career I broke scientific protocol, which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals, and then begin to talk about them.
在我科学生涯中，我第一次 打破了科学的协议， 就是做出数据并发布在科学杂志上， 然后再谈论它们。
We sent a very polite letter to the minister of health in Japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation, not for us, but for the people of Japan.
我们写了一封很客气的信 给日本卫生部长 并简单的指出 并非对于我们是一个不可忍受的情况， 而是对于日本人民。
Because mothers who may be breastfeeding, who may have young children, would be buying something that they thought was healthy, but it was really toxic.
因为需要哺乳的母亲们， 有小孩的母亲们， 应该买她们认为健康的东西， 但这些东西实际上有毒。
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan.
这导致了日本一系列的其他运动。
And I'm really proud to say that at this point, it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan that's labeled incorrectly, even though they're still selling whale meat, which I believe they shouldn't.
在这一点上，我真的非常骄傲的说， 在日本买任何东西都很难 这是标签贴错了， 即使他们仍然在出售鲸肉， 而我认为他们不该这么做。
But at least it's labeled correctly, and you're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead.
但是至少标签帖对了 你就不回再去买 有毒的海豚肉。
It isn't just there that this happens, but in a natural diet of some communities in the Canadian arctic and in the United States and in the European arctic, a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of PCBs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women.
并不是只有日本才这样， 而是在一些国家的自然食物链都这样 在加拿大北部，在美国 还有欧洲北部， 海豹和鲸鱼的自然食物链 导致了PCB分子的富集 从世界上的各个地方 聚集到妇女的身上。
These women have toxic breast milk.
这些妇女的乳汁含毒。
They cannot feed their offspring, their children, their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain, in their part of the world's ocean pyramid.
她们不能用她们的乳汁 来喂养她们的孩子们 因为富集的毒素 在她们的食物链之中， 在她们世界中的一部分 在海洋金字塔食物链里。
That means their immune systems are compromised.
这说明她们的免疫系统已经受到危害。
It means that their children's development can be compromised.
这说明她们后代的生长发育 也会受到危害。
And the world's attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women, not by changing the pyramid, but by changing what they particularly eat out of it.
近十年世界上对这一问题的关注 已经帮助这些妇女 解决了这个问题， 不是通过改变食物链结构， 而是改变她们特有的饮食。
We've taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem.
我们已经让这些妇女脱离自然的食物链 目的就是解决这个问题。
That's a good thing for this particular acute problem, but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem.
对于这个特别尖锐的问题，这是个好办法， 但它对解决金字塔食物链问题没什么帮助。
There's other ways of breaking the pyramid.
还有另一种方法打破金字塔食物链。
The pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom, can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.
如果我们在金字塔食物链底部塞入一些东西， 食物链可以像下水道那样回堵上来。
And if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer in the base of that pyramid, it can back up all through it.
如果我们在食物链底部加入 营养物质、污水和化肥， 那将影响整个食物链。
And we end up with things we've heard about before: red tides for example, which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage.
下面用我们之前听过的例子结束这件事： 赤潮， 赤潮里有大量有毒藻类， 漂浮在海洋之上的赤潮 能造成精神受损。
We can also get blooms of bacteria, blooms of viruses in the ocean.
我们也可能会让海洋里的细菌， 和病毒大量繁殖。
These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio, which includes the genus that has cholera in it.
这里的两张照片都是红潮的 这里面有 一种弧菌， 带有霍乱细菌。
How many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?
有多少人见过“海岸禁入”的标志呢？
Why does that happen?
为什么会这样呢？
It happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches.
因为我们把太多垃圾 扔到了海洋食物链的底部 这些细菌大量繁殖， 并回溢到我们的海滩上。
Often what jams us up is sewage.
一般困扰我们的都是污水。
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying, "Closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can't use it"?
那么有多少人曾经去过州立公园或是国家公园呢？ 在那的门口曾经看到一块大标志上这样写着吗？ “因垃圾太多 充斥公园 而关闭”
Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that.
不常见吧？我们不能容忍这种事情。
We wouldn't tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage.
我们不能容忍公园 被垃圾堆满。
But beaches are closed a lot in our country.
但是在我们国家海岸却关闭了很多。
They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason.
世界各地越来越多，越来越多的海岸关闭都是因为同样的原因。
And I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.
我相信这些我们也不应该容忍。
It's not just a question of cleanliness.
这不只是清洁的问题。
It's also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease.
同时也是 海洋有机物如何 进入到人类疾病中的问题。
These vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people.
那些弧菌和细菌确实可以感染人类。
They can go into your skin and create skin infections.
它们可以进入皮肤并造成皮肤感染。
This is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative, showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years.
这张图是来自美国国家气象局提议的海与人类健康法案， 说明过去几年中， 越来越多的人 受到弧菌感染。
Surfers, for example, know this incredibly.
举例来说，冲浪的人十分了解这一情况。
And if you can see on some surfing sites, in fact, not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather's like, but on some surf rider sites, you see a little flashing poo alert.
如果你登录一些冲浪网站， 实际上不光能看到 海浪和天气如何， 有一些冲浪者网站， 还会有一些闪烁的警示。
That means that the beach might have great waves, but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them, even after a great day of surfing, this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.
这表示海边可能有大浪， 但这对冲浪者来说是危险的 因为他们会一直携带海洋中的细菌， 即使是在冲浪之后的很多天， 这些遗留物造成的感染也许要花很长时间去治疗。
Some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now.
现在其中的一些细菌确实携带了 抗生素抗体遗传因子。
And that makes them even more difficult.
这就使得治疗更加困难。
These same infections create harmful algal blooms.
这些传染源 使得有害藻类大量繁殖。
Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.
繁殖会产生其他的化学物质。
This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms: shellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning -- you don't want to know about that -- neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.
这是几种有毒物质的清单 说明了这些有毒海藻的危害： 贝毒、甲藻鱼毒、 痢疾性贝毒——你不会想了解这种毒的—— 神经性贝毒、麻痹性贝毒。
These are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms.
这些有害物质因为海藻大量繁殖 而进入到我们的食物链中。
Rita Calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities, brought there, not by a normal human vector, but by a marine vector, this copepod.
丽塔·卡威尔成功的 追寻到一个有趣的故事 是关于人类感染霍乱的， 他们不是被 正常人传染 而是被海上的一种桡足动物传染的。
Copepods are small crustaceans.
桡足动物是小甲壳动物。
They're a tiny fraction of an inch long.
只有几分之一英寸长。
And they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease.
弧菌会依附在 它们细小的腿上 然后使人类得病。
That has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn't move these vectors of cholera around the world.
这引发了霍乱病 沿着港口传向整个世界 并迫使人们注意到 要努力不让船只 成为向世界传播 霍乱病的传染源。
So what do you do?
我们该做点什么呢？
We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well, that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged.
我们主要的问题是生态系统运转遭到破坏 金字塔食物链也运转不畅， 食物链从底部开始 就处于阻塞状态。
What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?
该怎么处理这种流通不畅的问题呢？
Well, there's a bunch of things you could do.
其实有很多能做的事。
You could call Joe the Plumber, for example.
例如，可以叫水管工来修理。
And he could come in and fix the flow.
他就会进来 并疏通管道。
But in fact, if you look around the world, not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems, there have been places where problems have been fixed, where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around.
但实际上，如果放眼世界 就不光是希望解决 我们能解决的问题， 有些地方的问题已经解决了， 有些地方的人们已经了解了这些问题 并开始寻求解决办法。
Monterey is one of those.
蒙特雷就是其中之一。
I started out showing how much we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems.
在开始的时候我展示了 蒙特雷海岸生态系统已经被破坏的程度 这是因为污染和罐头工厂 还有随之而来的各种问题。
In 1932 that's the picture.
这是1932年的照片。
In 2009 the picture is dramatically different.
2009年的照片中已经有明显不同。
The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.
罐头工厂迁走了，污染也减轻了。
But there's a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems.
但更有意义的是 社区居民所需的 是一个健全的生态系统。
They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.
他们需要从下到上功能良好的金字塔食物链。
And that pyramid in Monterey, right now, because of the efforts of a lot of different people, is functioning better than it's ever functioned for the last 150 years.
目前在蒙特雷 这条食物链， 在各方人士的努力之下， 功能前所未有的健全 150年来从未如此。
It didn't happen accidentally.
这不是突然发生的。
It happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this.
这是因为许多人付出了时间和精力 并投入了先驱者的精神。
On the left there, Julia Platt, the mayor of my little home town in Pacific Grove.
左边这位，朱丽娅·普拉特 是我家乡小镇葛洛芙洋的镇长
At 74 years old, became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean.
她在74岁的时候当选镇长 因为她做了一些 保护海洋的事情。
In 1931, she produced California's first community-based marine protected area, right next to the the biggest polluting cannery because Julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone, the ocean needed a place to grow from, that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed.
1931年，她设计了加州第一个 基于社区的海洋保护区， 紧挨着污染最重的罐头厂 因为朱丽娅知道 当罐头厂最终迁走之后， 海洋需要一块地方来复原， 换句话说海洋需要一块地方抛砖引玉。
And she wanted to provide that seed.
她想要成为这先驱者。
Other people David Packard and Julie Packard, who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium to lock into people's notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be.
其他人像大卫·帕卡德和朱莉·帕卡德， 他们帮助筹建了蒙特雷湾水族馆 以此让人们了解 这片海洋 和海洋生态系统的健康 和当地的经济发展一样重要 但经济发展却侵害了海洋生态。
That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift, not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay, but other places around the world.
这种思想上的转变已经导致了巨大的变化， 不仅改变了蒙特雷湾的命运 还影响了世界上的其他地方。
Well, I want to leave you with the thought that, what we're really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid.
接下来，我希望让你们知道， 我们正在尝试去做的事情 是保护海洋金字塔食物链。
And that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life.
而海洋食物链 和我们的食物链紧密相连。
It's an ocean planet, and we think of ourselves terrestrial species.
这是个海洋星球， 虽然我们认为自己是陆地生物。
But the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected.
但是海洋生物的食物链 和我们陆地生物 有着紧密的联系。
And it's only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves.
只有让海洋健康 我们才能确保自身的健康。
Thank you very much.
十分感谢。
The beginning of any collaboration starts with a conversation.
Forrest North:任何合作的开始 都起源于一段交谈
And I would like to share with you some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.

I grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me when I was between seven and 10 years old.
我在欧洲长大 那时正好是二战时期 我是7岁到10岁的光景
And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them -- how few of them could even resemble a normal, contented, satisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security was destroyed by the war.
我体会到 身边的大人 没有几个能够经受得起战争带给他们的创伤 很少可以重建起一种正常的、舒心的 满意的、快乐的生活 因为他们的工作、家庭以及 安全都因为战争而失去
So I became interested in understanding what contributed to a life that was worth living.
于是我开始对 什么元素的注入可以丰富人们的生活这一话题发生兴趣
And I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that I could see as a possible answer to that question.
那是我还是孩子 不过也开始读哲学的书 并且尝试过艺术、宗教等各种我认为 可以为我解开谜团的途径
And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance.
最终则是意外的与心理学结了缘
Actually I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and there was -- I didn't have money to go to a movie, but I found that on the -- I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich, and it was about flying saucers he was going to talk.
那次我去到了瑞士的一个滑雪胜地 身上分文都没有 我是去那玩的 那时雪已消融 我没钱去看电影 但是我从报纸上看到说 将会有一场演讲 地点是苏黎世市中心一个我去过的地方 他要讲的是飞碟
And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies, at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers.
我就想 既然不能去看电影 但至少可以去听一下这个讲飞碟的演讲吧
And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting.
那晚上的演讲非常有趣
And it -- actually, instead of talking about little green men, he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans had been traumatized by the war and now they're projecting flying saucers into the sky, kind of as a -- he talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war.
他没有讲绿色皮肤的外星人 他讲到欧洲人的心灵如何因为 二战而受到了创伤 因而就以放飞碟来自娱 他还讲到古代印度的曼荼罗 也是在战后 被人扔到天空 以此来重新建立一种秩序
And this seemed very interesting to me.
我对此很感兴趣
And I started reading his books after that lecture.
于是就开始读相关的书
And that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about.
那人的名字是荣格 而那时我还不知道这个名字
Then I came to this country to study psychology and I started trying to understand these roots of happiness.
后来就到了美国学习心理学 我开始探寻幸福之本源
This is a typical result that many people have presented, and there are many variations on it.
这是很多人都展示过的一个结果 有很多个版本
But this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed in the United States since 1956 say that their life is very happy.
而这一个则显示 自1956年有调查记录以来 有30%的美国受访公民 说他们的生活非常快乐
And that hasn't changed at all.
这一点几乎没有变
Whereas the personal income, on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation, has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period.
但是同一时期的人均收入则增加了 两倍以上 接近三倍 这一统计已经是把通货膨胀算进去了
But you find essentially the same results, namely, that after a certain basic point which corresponds more or less to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level, increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are.
可是 结果基本是一致的 就是说 到了温饱线之上1000美元之后的某个点 收入的增加不会影响人们的幸福值
And, in fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources, material resources, contributes to unhappiness, but the increase in material resources do not increase happiness.
而基本生活物资之匮乏 则会导致不幸福 但持续的物质财富之增长并不会带来更大的幸福
So my research has been focused more on -- after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience, I tried to understand now, where in everyday life, in our normal experience, do we feel really happy.
所以 当我发现这些东西与我自身的经历相吻合时 我在后来的研究里 就开始询问 在正常的日常生活中 我们怎么才会感到幸福
And to start that -- those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people -- first artists and scientists and so forth -- trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune, but which made their life meaningful and worth doing.
研究刚开始的时候 我寻找那些有创意的人士 首先是艺术家、科学家 我尝试找到 是什么让他们感觉自己的一生是值得的 他们做的很多事情都不能带来荣誉和财富 但那样的事情使得他们的人生充满意义
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s.
这是1970年代美国最出色的一位作曲家
And the interview was 40 pages long.
我跟他的对话记录长达40页
But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview.
而这一段则是一个很好的总结 是对他的发言的总结
And it describes how he feels when composing is going well.
它描绘出作曲家在写曲子时的感受
And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state.
他讲的时候也是一种狂喜的状态
Now ecstasy in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something.
而狂喜一词在希腊语里的意思是 站在某个东西的边上
And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.
后来就成为一种心智状态的代名词 用来形容非正常的行为
So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality.
换言之 狂喜就是一种超越寻常的感觉
And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it's China, Greece, Hindu civilization, or the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life.
有趣的是 当我们想起 那些被公认为人类文明之巅峰的文明时 不管是在中国、希腊或者是印度 或玛雅、或埃及 我们所听说的 都是关于他们的狂喜的故事 而不是他们日常生活的琐事
We know the temples they built so -- where people could come to experience a different reality.
我们知道他们建了大型的殿堂 人们可以去到那样的地方去感受不一样的现实
We know about the circuses, the arenas, the theaters -- these are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.
还有马戏团的故事 斗兽场 戏院 这些都是文明之遗迹 也是当时的人们经常光顾的地方 他们去到那里去体验一种更加紧凑 更具节奏的生活
Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this, which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also.
这个人不需要去到这样的地方 这里 这块地方 就像一个古希腊的斗兽场 也是一个狂欢之地
We are participating in a reality which is different from that of everyday life that we're used to.
我们参与进去 所体验到的 与日常生活完全不一样
But this man doesn't need to go to there.
但这并不意味着我们必须去到那样的地方
He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks, and as he does that, he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination.
这位作曲家只需一张纸 就能够把整个乐曲写下来 与此同时 他在脑海里想象 一种从未有过的特殊的声音的组合
So once he gets to that point of beginning to create -- like Jennifer did in her improvisation -- a new reality, that is a moment of ecstasy.
只要他开始真正要创作 就像刚才珍妮弗的即兴演奏 他就进入了一种新的现实 进入狂喜
He enters that different reality.
那是不一样的现实
Now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn't exist.
他说 那是一种非常紧凑的体验 他似乎也感觉不到自己的存在
And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.
这也许有点夸张
But actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second.
但事实上我们的神经系统是无法 在一秒的时间里同时处理超过110比特的信息
And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying, you need to process about 60 bits per second.
你在听我说话 并且尝试去理解其中的意思 这就相当于处理60比特的信息
That's why you can't hear more than two people.
所以说 同时听到两个以上的人的会话是不可能的
You can't understand more than two people talking to you.
你不可能同时做到这一点
Well, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new, as this man does, he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels, or his problems at home.
假如你真的是全身心的投入此间 像这位作曲家那样去创造一种新的东西 就不可能再有精力 去感知他的身体在那一刻发生的变化
He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.
不知饥饿与劳累
His body disappears, his identity disappears from his consciousness, because he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do, to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration and at the same time to feel that he exists.
似乎整个躯体都消失了 在他的意识里不再有自己的存在 他没有那么多精力 事实上我们某个人都不可能做得到 因为做那样的事情确实需要全副身心的投入 他就不可能感知自己的存在了
So existence is temporarily suspended.
他的存在被暂时遗忘了
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.
他自己也说 他的手似乎能够不由自主的活动
Now, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel any awe or wonder, because I can't compose.
我也许对着自己的手看两个星期 也不能看出有什么不一样的地方 因为我不是作曲家
So what is that telling you here, but in other parts of the interview is that obviously this automatic, spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone who is very well-trained and who has developed technique.
这说明了什么？ 访谈当中还提到 这样一个自动的、自发的过程只有可能 发生在一个受过严格训练以及培养了良好的钢琴技艺的人身上
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical knowledge immersion in a particular field.
在创造力研究这一领域 有一个接近真理的说法是 没有10年时间的积累 是不可能产生出这类的奇迹的
Whether it's mathematics or music -- it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before.
不管是数学、音乐 都需要这样漫长的时间 来达到这个境界 达到一种全新的升华
Now, when that happens, he says the music just flows out.
而这样的事情一旦发生 他就说 音乐仿佛是流出来了。
And because all of these people I started interviewing -- this was an interview which is over 30 years old -- so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the "flow experience."
而我所采访的这些人 这是一个30年前的会议记录 很多人将此称为“即兴的流动” 这是我给过程起的名字是
And it happens in different realms.
它正在不同的领域内发生
For instance, a poet describes it in this form.
比如 有位诗人如此写到
This is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the United States.
这是我的一位学生 他采访了美国最杰出的作家、诗人
And it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.
同样也是一种狂喜的状态 在那种状态下 诗人们可以非常轻松的写出诗来
This poet describes it as opening a door that floats up in the sky -- very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.
这位诗人则说 那就有如打开了通往天际之窗 这个跟爱因斯坦所说的 关于相对论的设想非常相像 那时的爱因斯坦也是在苦苦的思考为何那样的事情会发生
But it happens in other activities.
在其他的领域也会发生这样的事情
For instance, this is another student of mine, Susan Jackson from Australia, who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world.
这是我的另一位学生 她叫苏珊·杰克逊，来自澳洲 她采访了世界上顶尖的运动健将
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater, the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person.
这是关于一位奥林匹克滑冰运动员的的介绍 也是同样的一段现象学的描述 描绘的是一个人的内心活动
You don't think it goes automatically if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.
你也许会认为那样的事情要自然的发生是不可能的 但只要当你将自己与音乐融为一体之时 就发现那是可能的
It happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote, called "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical, very socially responsible.
我最近写了一本书，里面也提到这样的例子 书名是《优良商业》 我采访了一些公司的总裁 同行们都认为那些人是非常成功的 并且他们做企业非常讲道德、有社会责任
You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it.
他们关于成功的定义是这样的 既帮助他人的同时 使自己乐在其中
And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say, you can't have just one of these things to be successful.
这些成功并且富有社会责任的总裁也说到 单单有其中一样是不足以令你成功的
If you want a meaningful job and successful job -- Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed.
假如你要的是有意义的工作、成功的工作 安妮塔·罗迪克是其中一位受访的总裁
She is the founder of Body Shop, the cosmetic, kind of natural cosmetic king.
她创建了Body Shop，那是一个化妆品企业 她自己则成为了天然化妆品之母
It's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you're working.
这正是一种热情 它源自一个人对最高价值的追求 并且在工作中体会到一种“流动”
This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka, who was, at that time, starting out Sony without any money, without a product -- they didn't have a product, they didn't have anything, but they had an idea.
这是井深大说过的一句话 他那时手无分文，却创建了索尼 他们那时甚至连产品也拿不出来 可谓一无所有 但是他们有一个理念
And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation, be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content.
即他要创建一个工作环境 使得工程师可以体验到技术创新带来的快乐 同时也意识到自身对于社会的使命 以最大的热情工作 直到自己内心满意为止
I couldn't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace.
再也没有比这个更好的例子了 “流动”就是这样走进公司的
Now, when we do studies, we have, with other colleagues around the world, done over 8,000 interviews of people -- from Dominican monks, to blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds -- who enjoy their work.
而我们在做研究的时候 我们与世界其他地区的研究员一起 访问了8000人，他们有的是多米尼加的和尚 失明的尼姑、喜马拉雅山攀登者、納瓦霍牧羊人 他们都喜欢自己的工作
And regardless of the culture, regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow.
不管他们身处什么地方 不管他们的教育背景如何 只要存在以下的七个条件 我们就能感受到“流动”的存在
There's this focus that once it becomes intense, leads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity, you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other, you get immediate feedback.
首先是精神的集中 集中到一定程度 就会走向狂喜 清醒 可以很清楚的知道自己下一刻该做什么 因为你能够得到即时的反馈
You know that what you need to do is possible to do, even though difficult, and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself, you feel part of something larger.
你知道自己将要做的 是可以做的 尽管会遇到不少困难 时间感也消失了 你甚至忘却了自我 似乎能感到自己属于某个更大的整体
And once those conditions are present, what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.
而一旦有了那样的征兆 你做的事情本身也会变得有意义
In our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.
我们的研究得出的结果是 人们的日常行为可以分为以下几大类
And we can measure this very precisely, actually, because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day, and whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel, where you are, what you're thinking about.
我们可以非常准确的去测量 我们会给参与测试的人发电子纸 那样的纸每天会发出十次叫声 它一叫 你就马上说自己正在干什么 你在哪里 你正在想的是什么
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skills that they feel they have at that moment.
我们测量的，一是人们在某一刻所面临的挑战的难度 另一个是那一刻人们的技能熟练程度 靠的是参与者自己说明
So for each person we can establish an average, which is the center of the diagram.
对于每一位参与者 我们都能找到一个中间线 即图表中的中线
That would be your mean level of challenge and skill, which will be different from that of anybody else.
那是平均挑战难度以及技能熟练程度 这个会与其他人的不一样
But you have a kind of a set point there which would be in the middle.
同样 在中间的地方会有一个固定的点
If we know what that set point is, we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow, and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average.
假如我们能够知道这个固定的点在哪里 我们就能大致预测出你何时会走进“流动”的状态 那就是挑战大于平均值 技能熟练程度也大于平均值的时候
And you may be doing things very differently from other people, but for everyone that flow channel, that area there, will be when you are doing what you really like to do -- play the piano, probably, be with your best friend, perhaps work, if work is what provides flow for you.
你做的事情也许和其他人做的很不一样 但是，对于每一个人，流动的出现 通常都是在你做自己真正热爱的事情的时候才出现 比如弹钢琴、跟好友在一起、甚或是工作 假如你可以在工作中感受到“流动”的话
And then the other areas become less and less positive.
而其他的区域则变得相对更加消极
Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there.
觉醒还是好的，因为你在那一点上还是有较大的挑战
Your skills are not quite as high as they should be, but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill.
尽管你的技能熟悉程度不是很高 但是可以很容易的进入“流动” 只要增强一下技能就行了
So, arousal is the area where most people learn from, because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone and that to enter -- going back to flow -- then they develop higher skills.
觉醒是大多数人学习的地方 他们在那样的区域就被迫走出舒适圈 而后走进流动 学会更高级的技能
Control is also a good place to be, because there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.
“控制”也是一个不错的地方 因为你能感到舒服 虽然不是很激动
It's not very challenging any more.
挑战也不是很强烈
And if you want to enter flow from control, you have to increase the challenges.
假如要从那里走进“流动” 就要增强挑战的程度
So those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into.
这两者是理想化的、相互补充的区域 从这些地方可以很容易的进入“流动”
The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal.
而挑战与技能的其他搭配，则会显得越来越消极。
Relaxation is fine -- you still feel OK.
休息是好的，因为你还能感到舒适。
Boredom begins to be very aversive and apathy becomes very negative -- you don't feel that you're doing anything, you don't use your skills, there's no challenge.
但厌倦就会产生反作用了 而冷漠则会带来非常消极的后果 因为你觉得自己根本就没有干出什么实际的事情 你没有在使用好你的技能 也没有什么挑战
Unfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy.
遗憾的是，很多人所经历的，大多是冷漠。
The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television, the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting.
而导致这种情绪的元凶，就是看电视，其次则是蹲茅厕。
And then, even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow, but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it.
虽然有时候看电视，也有7%-8%的时间是处于“流动”，但那是在你挑选了一个你真正喜欢的频道的时候，你能够得到即时的反馈。
So the question we are trying to address -- and I'm way over time -- is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.
因此，我们要问的问题是，如何使得我们的生活更多的处于“流动”的状态。
And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.
我们正在慢慢的解开其中的秘密。
And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't.
你们当中有人懂得如何去做，哪怕我不给你任何提示，可惜大多数人都不会。
And that's what our mandate is in a way to do. OK.
而我们的任务之一，就是帮助那些人寻找到做事情的方法。
I want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is, what it could be, and what your relationship to it is.
我希望可以帮助大家重新理解什么是慈善，以及慈善可以怎么做，还有是你们可以跟 慈善发生什么关系。
And in doing that, I want to offer you a vision, an imagined future, if you will, of how, as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it, "Once in a lifetime the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope and history rhyme."
为了达到那样的目的，我希望可以给大家带来一个视界，一个想象中的未来，就如诗人Seamus Heaney所说的 “人生中总会有那么一次 人们期待已久的正义的浪潮会卷起， 希望与历史也与之呼应。”
I want to start with these word pairs here.
我想先是由这些词语的配对开始
We all know which side of these we'd like to be on.
我希望大家可以知道我们到底是站在那一边
When philanthropy was reinvented a century ago, when the foundation form was actually invented, they didn't think of themsevles on the wrong side of these either.
一百年前，当人们重新发明慈善的时候 基金会的形式被发明出来了 那时候的人们也不会想到他们是站在了错误的一边。
In fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways, as slow to respond to new challenges, as small and risk-averse.
事实上，他们根本也不会想到 那时候的慈善做法是非常封闭、保守 反应迟钝 规模小、并且常常规避风险的
And in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times.
但事实上那不是。在那个时代，我们的前辈事实上是在重新发明慈善。
What Rockefeller called "The business of benevolence."
洛克菲勒称之为“仁慈的事业”。
But by the end of the twentieth century, a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way.
到了20世纪的末期，新一代的批评家以及改革家，就是以这样的方式来看待慈善的。
The thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about, and that's exactly what is happening, is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions.
而当一个全球性的慈善事业，发展起来之后，——这恰恰是正在发生的事情，——我们需要的是重新评估老的法则，甚至是颠覆以往对慈善的假定。
For philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected, in service of the long term.
要使得慈善成为一个可以长期延续的、开放的 迅速发展、相互关联的体系。
This entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters.
这样一种创业的精神，现在正是从各个方面展现出来。
And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here, by new tools, like the ones we've seen here, by new pressures.
很多新的领袖，像这里的很多人正在推进促使它的发展 新的工具，比如我们在这里所看到的这些 新的压力也同样起着推进作用
I've been following this change for quite a while now, and participating in it.
我很久以前就在跟踪这一动态，并且参与其中。

What I want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you.
我希望可以与大家分享一些最有趣的故事 这些故事也许就发生在你们的身上
And as I do that, I'm not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about, the Gates and the Soros and the Google.
需要指出的是，我不打算谈大的慈善 这里很多人都已经讲过了 那也是盖茨、索罗斯和Google在做的事情
Instead, what I want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us.
我今天想说的，是我们所有人的 慈善

或曰慈善的民主化。
This is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time.
这也是普通人 也能比历史上的人拥有更多力量的时代
What I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments, each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy.
我想给大家看看五个方面的实验 他们每一个都挑战着我们对于慈善的传统看法
The first is mass collaboration, represented here by Wikipedia.
首先是大规模协作，其代表就是维基百科
Now, this may surprise you.
这也许真的会让你感到吃惊
But remember, philanthropy is about giving of time and talent, not just money.
但你必须记住，慈善本来就是一种付出时间与精力的行为，而不是金钱
Clay Shirky, that great chronicler of everything networked, has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way.
Clay Shirky这位著名的网络记录者， 就非常漂亮的记录了时代变化所带来的新契机 写得非常好
He said, "We have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money.
他说，我们生活的这个世界 人们为了爱去做小事 为赚钱去做大事
Now we have Wikipedia.
而现在，我们有维基百科
Suddenly big things can be done for love."
突然，我们也可以因为喜爱而成就大事
Watch, this spring, for Paul Hawken's new book.
今年春天，保罗·霍肯出了一本新书
Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about.
——相信你们很多人都认识这位作家和企业家
The book is called "Blessed Unrest."
那本书的书名是《看不见的力量》
And when it comes out, a series of wiki sites under the label WISER, are going to launch at the same time.
书推出的时候，也推出了系列的基于维基的网站 并且都带有WISER这个标志
WISER stands for World Index for Social and Environmental Responsibility.
WISER的意思是 全球社会与环境责任索引
WISER sets out to document, link and empower what Paul calls the largest movement and fastest growing movement in human history.
它的使命是记录这一保罗所称的人类历史上最规模大 发展最为迅速的运动 连结他们，为他们带来更大的力量
Humanity's collective immune response to today's threats.
整个人类作为一个有机体 在协力迎对今天的挑战
Now, all of these big things for love experiments aren't going to take off.
当然，并非上述所讲的这些大的追求 都会轻易成功。
But the ones that do are going to be the biggest, the most open, the fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history.
但是，那些最终走向成功的项目 必将成为人类历史上规模最大、最为开放 发展最为迅速以及联系最为广泛 的慈善行动
Second category is online philanthropy marketplaces.
第二类是在线的慈善行动
This is, of course, to philanthropy what eBay and Amazon are to commerce.
这就如慈善领域的 eBay以及Amazon
Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.
或者你可以将其看作是点对点的慈善
And this challenges yet another assumption, which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy.
这又挑战了我们 的另外一个设想 即慈善仅仅是富人才干得起的事情
Take a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose.
假如你还不知道，请看看 DonorsChoose 这个网站吧

And it goes on and on.
以及其他很多很多。
The third category is represented by Warren Buffet, which I call aggregated giving.
第三类是由巴菲特所代表的汇集性捐助。
It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer.
这里要看到的是，不仅仅巴菲特非常慷慨，特别是当你看到他把大部分财产捐给盖茨基金会的时候
It's that he challenged another assumption, that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation.
而且他的行为也挑战了另外一个传统观念，即每一位捐助者都应当设立一个基金或基金会。
There are now, today, so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing, bringing together people around a common goal, to think bigger.
这个社会涌现出了大量新的基金，它们正慢慢的汇集起来，被用来投资，让关心同样问题的人得以走到一块，去想象一个更宽广的未来。
One of the best known is Acumen Fund, led by Jacqueline Novogratz, a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED.
其中一个很好的例子就是 Acumen Fund，它是由 Jacqueline Novogratz 主管的 她也多次在TED的舞台上谈及这样的经历
But there are many others. New Profit in Cambridge, New School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley, Venture Philanthropy Partners in Washington, Global Fund for Women in San Francisco.
这样的例子还有很多。比如 New Profit，它是位于剑桥的 位于硅谷的 New School's Venture Fund 位于华盛顿的 Venture Philanthropy Partners 位于旧金山的 Global Fund for Women
Take a look at these.
看看这些例子吧。
These funds are to philanthropy what venture capital, private equity, and eventually mutual funds are to investing.
这些基金对于慈善行业的意义，就有如投资基金、私人投资以及共同资金，对投资行业的意义。
But with a twist, because often a community forms around these funds, as it has at Acumen and other places.
但这里有一个非常巧妙的地方，因为很多时候社区就是围绕着这些基金形成的，这样的事情已经在 Acumen以及其他地方发生了
Now, imagine for a second these first three types of experiments, mass collaboration, online marketplaces, aggregated giving.
好吧，现在大家设想一下 这三样的实验 大规模协作、在线慈善以及汇聚性的捐助。

ONE of the oddest things about Homo sapiens is that he is alone. 
有关智人的最奇怪的事情之一就是他们在人类的进化史上十分孤独。
Though storytellers have filled the world with imaginary hominids-from woodland pixies to mountain giants-no sign of the real thing has ever been seen.  
尽管故事家们想象出了许多人种来丰富这个世界，从森林里的小精灵到山上的巨人等等，但人们却从未找到能证明这些人种真实存在的迹象。
But that was not true in the past.
但从过去来看，这样的说法并不正确。
As recently as 40,000 years ago there were three other species of human on Earth: Neanderthals in Europe, the "hobbits" of Flores, in Indonesia, and a recently discovered and still mysterious group of creatures called the Denisovans, who lived in Central Asia. 
早在4万年前，地球上还存在另外三个人种：欧洲的尼安德塔人，印度尼西亚佛洛里斯岛上的"霍比特人"，以及最近才发现的一个叫丹尼索瓦人的神秘人种，该人种曾居住在亚洲中部。
And now there is evidence that similar diversity existed earlier in human history, a little under 2m years ago, in Africa.
而现在，人们在非洲又找到了另一个人种存在的证据，该人种在人类进化史上出现的时间更早，距今约不到200万年。
This evidence, just published in Nature, has been provided by a team led by Meave Leakey of the Turkana Basin Institute in Nairobi, Kenya. Dr Leakey is a member of an illustrious palaeontological clan. 
这些发表在《自然》杂志上的证据是由肯尼亚首都内罗毕的图尔卡纳盆地研究所的一个研究小组提供的。该研究小组的领导人米芙•利基来自一个著名的古生物学研究家族，
The problem with studying humanity's fossil record is that it is so sparse: a jawbone here; a braincase there. 
研究人类化石记录最大的问题是资源稀缺，总是这儿一块颚骨，那儿一块头骨。
Often, it is difficult to know if different bones have come from the same species or not. 
而且研究者通常很难分辨它们是否来自同一人种。
Even multiple examples of the same type of bone can mislead. What looks like two species might actually be the male and the female of one.
即便是同一人种，不同样本也会给人带来误导，两块看起来像是来自不同人种的骨头实际上可能分属于同一人种的男性和女性。
Such confusion has bedevilled the interpretation of the human fossils found near Lake Turkana. 
这种极易混淆的情况一直困扰着那些想要解读图尔卡纳湖附近人类化石的研究者们。
Some palaeontologists see a single, variable species called Homo habilis. 
有一些古生物学家认为人种是单一的，即只有能人一种，其他人种都是能人的变异体。
The new fossils found by Dr Leakey and her team (which includes a third Leakey generation in the form of her daughter, Louise) may, however, help clear up what is going on.
而利基博士与她的团队（该团队成员还包括利基家族的第三代人，即利基的女儿路易斯）最新发现的人类化石或许可以帮忙理清这些人种之间的关系。
One of the new specimens, known as KMN-ER 62000, has a face like the type specimen of Homo rudolfensis (the fossil that defines the species, if species it turns out to be), though it seems to be from an adolescent, whereas the type specimen is an adult. 
这些新发现的样本中有一个被标为KMN-ER 62000的新样本，其脸型与卢尔多夫人样本（该化石是用来鉴别卢尔多夫人人种的一个样本，如果研究者能用此种方式辨认出样本属于卢尔多夫人种）的脸型相似，尽管62000样本看起来像是来自一个青少年，而卢尔多夫人化石样本则属于一个成年人。
Crucially, 62000 has a reasonably well-preserved upper jaw, which the type specimen lacks. 
关键是，62000样本拥有一个保存相当完好的上颌，而这正是这一类型的样本所缺少的。
A computer reconstruction (see diagram) suggests this upper jaw meshes well with the second of Dr Leakey's discoveries, a lower jaw (KMN-ER 60000). 
一张电脑重建图（见上图）显示这一上颌与利基博士发现的第二个人种的一个下颌样本（KMN-ER 60000）十分吻合。
She is not suggesting they are from the same individual, since they are of different ages, but they seem to come from the same species, namely Homo rudolfensis.
由于两块骨头分属两个年龄不同的人，因此利基博士并不认为这两块骨头是来自同一个人的，但看起来这两块骨头的主人属于同一人种，即卢尔多夫人。
Equally significantly, a different computer reconstruction shows that the upper jaw of 62000 does not match another famous fossil from the area, known as KMN-ER 1802. 
同样重要的是，另一张电脑重建图显示，62000样本的上颌与KMN-ER 1802样本并不吻合。
This was found in 1973 and had previously been thought likely to be the lower jaw of rudolfensis.
KMN-ER 1802这块有名的样本化石同样来自这个地区，1973年人们发现它时曾认为这块下颌骨可能属于卢尔多夫人种。
What 1802 actually is, is now obscure. 
现在人们仍旧无法弄清1802样本到底属于哪个人种。
It is too different from what this chain of reasoning suggests was the shape of Homo rudolfensis to be explained by sexual dimorphism, unless the sexes differed in this species in ways not seen in any other primate. 
这一推理链认为它是卢尔多夫人，并以人种的两性差异来解释其外形差异；但这一差异实在太大，除非这一人种的两性差异在其他灵长类动物中见所未见方能自圆其说。
But its previous attribution was made because it does not look much like Homo habilis either.
但之前人们之所以将其归为卢尔多夫人种是因为它看起来也并不像是能人的下颌。
It seems then that at least two, and possibly three species of Homo were stalking the east-African savannah a little under 2m years ago: habilis, rudolfensis and something as yet unnamed. 
这样看起，在距今不到200万年前，曾有三个人种在东非大草原上生活过：能人，卢尔多夫人，以及一个尚未被命名的人种。
The intertwining history of the human family and the Leakey family has just become even more complicated.
利基家族一直都致力于研究人类大家族的历史，现在二者之间的关系交织在一起，使历史更加复杂了。
Watching a film that makes you laugh is good for your heart, according to a study. 
有研究显示，看一部能让您开心、乐呵呵的片子对身心都有好处，特别是心血管健康方面。
Researchers found watching a movie or programme that produces laughter has a positive effect on vascular function and is opposite to that observed after watching a war or horror film that causes mental stress。
据悉，一部能使人发笑的电影可以对人体的血管起到优化作用，这是相对看了战争片以及惊悚片后的比较而言的。
In the study volunteers watched segments of a funny film - such as There's Something About Mary starring Cameron Diaz - on one day and on another day watched the opening segment of the stressful war film Saving Private Ryan。
在实验中，研究员让志愿者看了喜剧片演的《关于玛丽的一切 》以及战争片《拯救大兵瑞恩》，在观察志愿者观看影片后的反映进行分析对比。
Lead investigator Dr Michael Miller from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the U.S. said that when the volunteers watched the stressful film, their blood vessel lining developed a potentially unhealthy response called vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow. He said this finding confirms previous studies, which suggested there was a link between mental stress and the narrowing of blood vessels。
领衔实验的研究员Dr Michael Miller 说：“在实验中，当志愿者观看惊悚片时，他们的血管收缩呈现不健康的反映，比如--减小血管直径使供给某区域的血流减少，换句话来说就是血流量减少速度过快。这证明了先前实验的结论--精神压力大与血管收缩之间有直接的联系。”
However, after watching the funny movie, the blood vessel lining expanded. Overall, more than 300 measurements were made with a 30 to 50 per cent difference in blood vessel diameter between the laughter and mental stress phases. Dr Miller said: 'The take-home message here is that laughter is great for your heart。
与之相反，在观看完喜剧片之后，志愿者的“血管直径”与观看惊悚片后相比，呈现30%到50%的差异，结论证明，乐观的心态、经常大笑有益心血管健康。
The time of year a baby is born can shape what profession they will embark on in later life, a new study has suggested。

A February birth appears to increase the chances of being an artist while March babies appear to go on to become pilots。
出生在二月份的小孩成为艺术家的几率更高，而三月份出生的宝宝似乎更可能成为飞行员。
Meanwhile, April and May are said to have a fairly even spread of professions, births in the summer months mean a much lower chance of becoming a high-earning football player, doctor or dentist。
此外，四月和五月出生的小孩从事各类职业的几率都比较均等，在夏天出生的小孩成为高收入的足球运动员、医生或牙医的几率要低得多。
The study was derived by researchers who analysed the birth months of people in 19 separate occupations using information from the last census, the Daily Mail reported。
据《每日邮报》报道，研究人员分析了从事19类不同职业的人的出生月份，从而得出这一结论。该研究采用了来自上一次人口普查的信息。
Although these trends may be difficult to explain, correlations between birth months and specific health problems have a scientific basis。
尽管这些趋向性也许难以解释，但是出生月份和特定健康问题之间的关联却是有科学根据的。
Spring babies are at greater risk of illnesses including schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, asthma and autism。
春天出生的小孩患精神分裂症、老年痴呆症、哮喘和自闭症等疾病的风险会更大。
They may also be less clever than classmates born in other parts of the year。
他们可能也会不如其他月份出生的同学聪明。

Anger and other strong emotions can trigger potentially deadly heart rhythms in certain vulnerable people, US researchers said on Monday.
周一美国调查人员声明，对于某些虚弱的人群，生气和其他强烈的情绪可能会引发潜在的致命的心脏疾病。
Previous studies have shown that earthquakes, war or even the loss of a World Cup Soccer match can increase rates of death from sudden cardiac arrest, in which the heart stops circulating blood.
之前的研究已经表明，地震、战争、甚至输了一场世界杯都会增加突发心搏停止而死的机率，在这种情况下心脏停止了供血循环。
"It's definitely been shown in all different ways that when you put a whole population under a stressor that sudden death will increase," said Dr. Rachel Lampert of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, whose study appears in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology."Our study starts to look at how does this really affect the electrical system of the heart," Lampert said.
耶鲁大学的Rachel Lampert博士说：“不同研究证实了当你处在一个压力过强的群体时，突然死亡的可能性将会增加，”她的研究发表在美国心脏病学院的期刊上。Lampert博士讲到：“我们的研究着手寻找它怎样影响心脏系统。”
She and colleagues studied 62 patients with heart disease and implantable heart defibrillators or ICDs that can detect dangerous heart rhythms or arrhythmias and deliver an electrical shock to restore a normal heart beat. 
她和她的研究团队研究了62例有心脏病和植入心脏的患者，发现了异常的心律或心律不齐的现象，并通过电击来恢复患者正常的心跳。
"These were people we know already had some vulnerability to arrhythmia," Lampert said in a telephone interview.
Lampert博士在一次电话采访中讲到：“我们的这些研究对象有心率不齐的现象。”
Patients in the study took part in an exercise in which they recounted a recent angry episode while Lampert's team did a test called T-Wave Alternans that measures electrical instability in the heart.
在这次研究中的患者参加了一项实验，这实验中要求这些患者回忆最近一次的发怒的情形。这个实验，Lampert的团队将其命名为T波变换实验，它是用来测量心电流的不稳定的现象。
Lampert said the team specifically asked questions to get people to relive the angry episode. 
Lampert博士说团队特别询问了一些问题来缓解这些发怒的情形。
"We found in the lab setting that yes, anger did increase this electrical instability in these patients," she said.
“我们发现在实验室里，发怒增加了这些患者的心电流的不稳定。”她说
Next, they followed patients for three years to see which patients later had a cardiac arrest and needed a shock from their implantable defibrillator. 
接下来，他们连续追踪这些患者长达三年之久，检查哪些病人有心搏停止或者移植体内的电震发生器震动的状况。
"The people who had the highest anger-induced electrical instability were 10 times more likely than everyone else to have an arrhythmia in follow-up," she said.
Lampert博士说，“那些有着最高的生气引发的心电流不稳定是其他患者患心率不齐机率的10倍。”
Lampert said the study suggests that anger can be deadly, at least for people who are already vulnerable to this type of electrical disturbance in the heart.
Lampert博士说这项研究表明发怒是致命的，至少对于那些已经有心电流不稳定的人群是致命的。
"It says yes, anger really does impact the heart's electrical system in very specific ways that can lead to sudden death," she said.
“这证明发怒将会导致心电流体系在某种情况下致使突然的死亡。”她说。

If all of that can be done, any one of these technologies could be a game-changer.
如果能做到这一切，其中任何一项技术都可以改变游戏规则。
SPACE-BASED SOLAR POWER
太空利用太阳能
For more than three decades, visionaries have imagined tapping solar power where the sun always shines -- in space. 
30多年来，梦想家就一直设想在太阳永远能照耀到的地方──太空中──利用太阳能。
If we could place giant solar panels in orbit around the Earth, and beam even a fraction of the available energy back to Earth, they could deliver nonstop electricity to any place on the planet. 
如果我们能在环绕地球的轨道上安置巨大的太阳能电池板，将其中哪怕是一小部分的可用能源传回地球，它们可以向地球上的任何地方提供不间断的电力。
The technology may sound like science fiction, but it's simple: Solar panels in orbit about 22,000 miles up beam energy in the form of microwaves to earth, where it's turned into electricity and plugged into the grid. 
这项技术听起来可能像是科幻小说，但其实很简单：在22,000英里之外的太阳能电池板将能源以微波的形式传回地球，然后转化为电力并进入到电网中。
(The low-powered beams are considered safe.) 
（低能量的光束被认为是安全的。）
A ground receiving station a mile in diameter could deliver about 1,000 megawatts -- enough to power on average about one million U.S. homes. 
直径1英里的地面接收站可以提供约1,000兆瓦电力，足以供应平均约100万户美国家庭的使用。
The cost of sending solar collectors into space is the biggest obstacle, so it's necessary to design a system lightweight enough to require only a few launches. 
将太阳能收集器送至太空的成本是最大的障碍，因此有必要设计重量足够轻，可以减少发射次数的系统。
A handful of countries and companies aim to deliver space-based power as early as a decade from now.
已经有些国家和公司希望最早在未来10年内提供这种太空电力。
ADVANCED CAR BATTERIES
高级汽车电池
Electrifying vehicles could slash petroleum use and help clean the air (if electric power shifts to low-carbon fuels like wind or nuclear). 
电动汽车可以降低石油消耗量，有助于空气清洁（如果电力来自于风能和原子能等低碳燃料的话）。
But it's going to take better batteries.
但它需要使用更好的电池。
Lithium-ion batteries, common in laptops, are favored for next-generation plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles. 
笔记本电脑中常用的锂离子电池是下一代充电式混合动力车和电动车的理想之选。
They're more powerful than other auto batteries, but they're expensive and still don't go far on a charge; the Chevy Volt, a plug-in hybrid coming next year, can run about 40 miles on batteries alone. 
它们比其它汽车电池的电力更充足，但也更贵，不过充电后的行驶距离仍不够远；将于明年上市雪佛兰(Chevy) Volt混合动力车凭电池可行驶约40英里。
Ideally, electric cars will get closer to 400 miles on a charge. 
理想情况下，电动车充电一次最好能行驶近400英里。
While improvements are possible, lithium-ion's potential is limited.
尽管仍有改进的空间，但锂离子电池的潜力有限。
One alternative, lithium-air, promises 10 times the performance of lithium-ion batteries and could deliver about the same amount of energy, pound for pound, as gasoline. 
作为一种替代产品，锂空气电池的性能是锂离子电池的10倍，可以提供与汽油同等的能量。
A lithium-air battery pulls oxygen from the air for its charge, so the device can be smaller and more lightweight. 
锂空气电池从空气中吸收氧气充电，因此这种电池可以更小、更轻。
A handful of labs are working on the technology, but scientists think that without a breakthrough they could be a decade away from commercialization.
不少实验室都在研究这种技术，但科学家认为，如果没有重大突破，要想实现商用可能还需要10年。 
UTILITY STORAGE
电力储存技术
Everybody's rooting for wind and solar power. How could you not? 
所有人都在支持风能和太阳能技术，你怎能置身事外？
But wind and solar are use-it-or-lose-it resources. 
但风能和太阳能是那种要么利用要么流失的资源。
To make any kind of difference, they need better storage.
要改变现状，它们需要更好的储存技术。
Scientists are attacking the problem from a host of angles -- all of which are still problematic. 
科学家正在从诸多角度应对这个问题，但各个方面都面临难题。
One, for instance, uses power produced when the wind is blowing to compress air in underground chambers; the air is fed into gas-fired turbines to make them run more efficiently. 
举例来说，一项技术是通过风能将地下洞穴内的空气压缩产生电能；将空气输送至燃气涡轮机以提高燃烧功效。
One of the obstacles: finding big, usable, underground caverns.
这其中面临的一个障碍是：要寻找到大空间以及可用的地下洞穴。
Similarly, giant batteries can absorb wind energy for later use, but some existing technologies are expensive, and others aren't very efficient. 
类似的，还有能够吸收风能待日后使用的巨型电池，但当前的一些技术成本昂贵，其他技术则不是很有效率。
While researchers are looking at new materials to improve performance, giant technical leaps aren't likely.
尽管研究人员正在寻找新材料以提高性能，但要出现显著技术飞跃的可能性不大。
Lithium-ion technology may hold the greatest promise for grid storage, where it doesn't have as many limitations as for autos. 
锂离子技术可能是电网存储前景最好的技术，在这个领域内该技术不会面临像在汽车业中那样多的限制。
As performance improves and prices come down, utilities could distribute small, powerful lithium-ion batteries around the edge of the grid, closer to customers. 
随着性能提高和价格降低，公共事业机构可能会向电网边缘，较为靠近用户的地方输送小体积大容量的锂离子电池。
There, they could store excess power from renewables and help smooth small fluctuations in power, making the grid more efficient and reducing the need for backup fossil-fuel plants. 
这样，这些锂离子电池可以从可再生能源中存储多余的能源，有助于平抑电能供应的小波动，提高电网的效率，降低对备用火电厂的需求。
And utilities can piggy-back on research efforts for vehicle batteries. 
公用事业机构可以利用汽车电池的研究成果。
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE
碳捕捉和储存技术
Keeping coal as an abundant source of power means slashing the amount of carbon dioxide it produces. 
继续将煤炭作为一种主要的能源意味着需要努力去降低碳燃烧生成的二氧化碳。
That could mean new, more efficient power plants. 
这可能意味着要建设更高效的新发电厂。
But trapping C02 from existing plants -- about two billion tons a year -- would be the real game-changer.
但从当前的电厂捕捉二氧化碳（每年大约为20亿吨）可能是一个真正能够改变游戏规则的技术。
Techniques for modest-scale CO2 capture exist, but applying them to big power plants would reduce the plants' output by a third and double the cost of producing power. 
目前已经出现了小规模的二氧化碳捕捉技术，但如果将这些技术用于大型发电厂会导致发电量减少三分之一，并导致发电成本增长一倍。
So scientists are looking into experimental technologies that could cut emissions by 90% while limiting cost increases.
因此，科学家正在寻找既能够将碳排放量降低90%，又能限制成本增长的试验性技术。
Nearly all are in the early stages, and it's too early to tell which method will win out. 
几乎所有技术目前都处于初步阶段，目前断言哪种方法能够最终胜出还为时过早。
One promising technique burns coal and purified oxygen in the form of a metal oxide, rather than air; this produces an easier-to-capture concentrated stream of CO2 with little loss of plant efficiency. 
一个前景看好的技术是以金属氧化物的形式燃烧煤炭和纯净氧，而不是在空气中燃烧；这种方法会产生较容易捕捉的二氧化碳集中气流，几乎不会影响电厂的效率。
The technology has been demonstrated in small-scale pilots, and will be tried in a one-megawatt test plant next year. 
这种技术已经在小规模试点项目中进行了展示，明年将用于一个装机容量为一百万瓦的试验电厂。
But it might not be ready for commercial use until 2020.
但2020年之前，这种技术可能还难以投入商用。
NEXT-GENERATION BIOFUELS
下一代生物燃料
One way to wean ourselves from oil is to come up with renewable sources of transportation fuel. 
一个令我们逐步摆脱对石油依赖的途径就是研制出可再生的运输燃料。
That means a new generation of biofuels made from nonfood crops.
这意味着从非食品作物中研制出新一代的生物燃料。
Researchers are devising ways to turn lumber and crop wastes, garbage and inedible perennials like switchgrass into competitively priced fuels. 
研究人员正在想办法将木材、作物废料、垃圾以及柳枝稷等不可食用植物转化为具有价格优势的燃料。
But the most promising next-generation biofuel comes from algae.
但前景最为看好的新一代生物燃料来自于藻类。
Algae grow fast, consume carbon dioxide and can generate more than 5,000 gallons a year per acre of biofuel, compared with 350 gallons a year for corn-based ethanol.
藻类生长迅速，会消耗二氧化碳，一英亩藻类每年可以生成超过5,000加仑的生物燃料，而一英亩玉米每年只能生产350加仑的乙醇。
Algae-based fuel can be added directly into existing refining and distribution systems.
藻类燃料可以直接添加进当前的提炼和分销系统。
in theory, the U.S. could produce enough of it to meet all of the nation's transportation needs.
理论上来说，美国可以生产大量的藻类燃料，足以满足美国所有的交通运输需求。
But it's early. 
但现在还为时过早。
Dozens of companies have begun pilot projects and small-scale production. 
数十家公司已经开始了试点项目和小规模生产。
But producing algae biofuels in quantity means finding reliable sources of inexpensive nutrients and water, managing pathogens that could reduce yield, and developing and cultivating the most productive algae strains.
但量产藻类燃料意味着要寻找到可靠的、价格低廉的养分和水资源，控制可能导致减产的病原体，研发和培育产量最高的藻株。
Hungry prehistoric hunters, not climate change, drove elephants and wooly mammoths to extinction during the Pleistocene era, new research suggests.
在约一万年前的更新世，大象和猛犸象从地球上许多地区大量消失。一项新研究表明，导致这场灭绝的并不是气候剧变，而是饥饿的史前猎人。
One slips on so-so earnings – only $7bn in quarterly profits. The other jumps 3 per cent on a deal that will hurt its bottom line. 
一只股票因企业盈利表现一般而下滑——季度利润只有70亿美元。另一只股票则因一笔将会损害公司利润的交易而上涨3%。
It isn’t hard to see that the latter, Lenovo, has more market momentum than Samsung Electronics. 
不难看出，后者——联想比三星电子的市场势头更强劲。
Both make consumer electronics and tech hardware, from Lenovo’s new server business to Samsung’s chips. 
从联想的新服务器业务，到三星的芯片业务，两家公司都生产消费者电子产品和科技硬件。
Might Lenovo become the next Samsung?
联想会成为下一个三星吗？
On a size basis, the comparison is still a bit ridiculous. 
从规模上看，这样的比较仍有些可笑。
Samsung’s market capitalisation is $160bn; Lenovo’s, $14bn. 
三星的市值是1600亿美元；联想则是140亿美元。
Samsung’s profits last quarter were 10 times Lenovo’s for the past year. 
三星在最近一个季度的利润是联想过去一年利润的10倍。
Still, Lenovo’s deal this week to buy IBM’s X86 server business demonstrates that it still has the ambition it showed when it bought Big Blue’s PC business in 2004.
不过，联想近日收购IBM x86服务器业务的交易表明，它仍具备其2004年收购“蓝色巨人”个人电脑业务时所展现的雄心壮志。
The relatively low price paid – half of sales – reflects the IBM unit’s swing into loss last year. 
相对低廉的收购价格（相当于销售额的一半），反映了IBM该项业务去年陷入亏损。
The business will knock about 5 per cent off Lenovo’s full-year earnings per share, including the slight dilution from the shares issued to IBM. 
该业务将令联想的全年每股盈利削减5%，包括向IBM发行股票后造成的轻微稀释。
The shares’ rise suggests that investors think it can use its lower cost structure to lift profits.
股价上涨表明，投资者认为联想能以相对较低的成本结构来提高利润。
Investors like bold tech stories. 
投资者喜欢大胆的科技企业故事。
Samsung’s success was not born of timidity either. 
三星的成功也并非来自怯懦。
It has never bought in growth as Lenovo has, but has taken risks to move up the value chain. 
它从没有像联想那样通过收购来实现增长，但它曾冒风险向价值链上游转移。
One of the reasons for its unexpectedly poor earnings in the latest quarter was a Won800bn ($738m) bonus paid to employees to mark the 20th anniversary of a strategy. 
三星在最近一个季度意料之外的利润下滑，其中一个原因是它向员工支付了8000亿韩元（合7.38亿美元）的奖金，以庆祝其20年前实施的一项战略。
Back then its chairman made a bonfire of 150,000 mobile phones – worth $50m – to make the point he wanted better. 
当时三星主席将15万部手机（总值5000万美元）付之一炬，以此表达他期望打造更好产品的决心。
Now Samsung is trying to push into software – a challenge for a company staffed by hardware engineers.
现在三星正试图打入软件领域——对一家由硬件工程师组成的公司来说是个挑战。
Samsung’s shares have risen 20 per cent a year, compounded, for the past two decades. 
过去20年里，三星股价年均复合上涨20%。
Should Lenovo follow suit, it will take it a little over a decade to reach Samsung’s present size.
联想若能实现同样的成就，它将需要10年多一点的时间达到三星目前的规模。
Lenovo has momentum on its side. 
势头对联想有利。
But can it sustain profit growth on a foundation of low-cost manufacture of commodity hardware? 
但它能否以低成本制造平价商品化的硬件为基础，维持利润增长？
Samsung invested aggressively to acquire an enduring competitive advantage – scale – in chips, and from there built a hugely profitable premium phone business. 
三星通过大举投资，获得了芯片领域的持久竞争优势——规模，在此基础上建立了一个利润丰厚的高端手机业务。
Lenovo needs to find a similar edge.
联想需要找到类似的竞争优势。
Combining sales growth with cost cutting is not an innovative idea. 
把销售增长和成本削减相结合，不是什么新点子。
It represents, nonetheless, a shocking return to sanity in Chinese retailing. 
不过，当中国零售商开始这么做的时候，它们正不可思议地回归理智。
The 9 per cent opening pop in Gome’s shares after it raised its profits shows the importance of the simple improvements the company has made.
国美电器(Gome)在宣布利润上升后，股价开盘跳升9%，表明该公司做出的简单改进能带来多大的改变。
Last year Gome was lossmaking. 
去年，国美处于亏损状态。
It became caught in a vicious online battle for market share in China’s electrical appliances market, the largest ecommerce sector after clothes. 
它卷入了一场对中国网上家电市场的恶性争夺中。在中国，家电是仅次于服装的第二大电子商务市场。
Rivals such as 360 Buy, a purely online operator, had pledged zero gross margins for three years and other disrupting tactics. 
在国美之前，纯电商京东商城(360 Buy)等竞争对手承诺三年内零毛利，还使出了一些其他市场干扰手段。
Slowing sales that followed the expiry of some government subsidies hurt, too.
随着政府补贴到期，国内销售也开始放缓。
Yet this week Gome talked of same-store sales growing by 15 per cent (above overall retail sales) and an 18 per cent gross margin – half as much again as the level of three years ago. 
但国美本周宣布，2013年第四季度，其可比门店销售收入增长预期将超过15%，高于全年增幅，2013年综合毛利率预计将超过18%——再次达到三年前水平的一半。
Granted, that still lags behind the likes of Best Buy in the US, Japan’s Yamada Denki (23 per cent) and Europe’s Darty group (32 per cent), but the size of the improvement delivered by a tactic as basic as cost-cutting is impressive.
虽然这个水平仍然落后于美国百思买(Best Buy)、日本山田电机(Yamada Denki)的23%和欧洲Darty集团的32%，但通过削减成本这类简单策略，业绩改善效果仍然惊人。
More gains are possible. Consider inventory turnover, where Gome managed to cut its cycle by 14 days to 56 in the first half of 2013. 
国美还有更大改善空间。2013年上半年，它成功将库存周转天数降到56天，同比减少了18天。
It said then it thought there were another eight days it could trim over the next two years. 
当时国美表示，它认为未来两年还可以再减掉8天。
The company has focused on better positioning its store network and it is working: the rising sales have come on the back of less bricks-and-mortar space.
国美把注意力放在了对门店网络更好地布局上，而且此举正在见到成效：实体店数量减少之余，销售额却升上去了。
The real expansion in Chinese retail will be online, where sales could rise a quarter each year to 2018, Citi estimates. 
中国零售业真正的扩张将发生在互联网上。据花旗(Citi)估计，一直到2018年，中国线上零售额可能以每年25%的速度增长。
Gome still has to figure out how to make money from its online operations. 
国美仍须思考如何从线上运营中赚钱。
But in the meantime, do not ignore its achievement in swapping a disastrous online market share battle for a steady approach to bricks and mortar.
但同时，不要忽略国美的成就——放弃一场灾难性的网络市场份额争夺战，实实在在地改善实体店业绩。
Xi Guohua will not have to join any queues to get his iPhone. 
奚国华用不着排队就得到了一台iPhone。
The China Mobile chairman was given one by Apple chief Tim Cook. 
这位中国移动董事长刚得到苹果首席执行官蒂姆•库克送的一部iPhone。
Friday sees the launch of the iPhone on the Chinese network, with its mind-boggling 750m subscriber base. 
本周五，中国移动版iPhone正式发售，而该公司用户总数是惊人的7.5亿。
But the iPhone’s moment in the world’s biggest market comes just as the local competition is gearing up. 
不过，iPhone在世界最大的市场迎来激动人心的时刻之际，正是本土竞争加剧之时。
If, as Apple’s (and Samsung’s) margins suggest, even high-end smartphones are becoming less profitable, what are the likes of Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi thinking?
如果连高端智能手机的利润率都会下降的话——就像苹果和三星的利润率所体现的那样，那么像华为、联想和小米这样的生产商，又该作何感想呢？
Combined, China’s top 10 makers expect to shift more than 400m phones this year, a 50 per cent increase on 2013. 
2014年，中国十大手机制造商预计总共将销售手机逾4亿部，比2013年增长50%。
About 440m smartphones will be sold in China in 2014, according to Credit Suisse – a 25 per cent jump. 
据瑞信预测，中国今年的智能手机销量将达到约4.4亿部，同比增长25%。
That includes Apple, Samsung and other top-tier makers, implying the home brands must also be aiming for other emerging markets, where sales are expected to rise a third, to 470m Chinese makers often have high-end ambitions, but their bread and butter is in the low- and mid-range phones that rule emerging markets.
其中苹果、三星和其他第一梯队制造商会占据一些份额，意味着中国本土品牌也必须瞄准其他新兴市场，这些市场的手机销量预计将增加三分之一，达到4.7亿部。中国制造商往往有生产高端手机的抱负，但它们赖以为生的却是在新兴市场占主导地位的低端和中端产品。
Plentiful demand is one thing, making money is another. 
庞大的需求是一回事，赚钱是另一回事。
Apple and Samsung profit from using their scale and brands to cut costs and demand top dollar. 
苹果和三星的盈利法宝是利用规模和品牌来削减成本，并让消费者为其产品付尽可能高的价钱。
Low-end phones cost far less to make. 
低端手机的成本低得多。
The cost of producing a so-so brand 4.7’’ screen phone could be as low as $94, Credit Suisse reckons, compared with $266 for Samsung’s Galaxy S4. 
瑞信估计，生产一部4.7英寸、品牌一般的手机，最低只需94美元。相比之下，三星Galaxy S4的生产成本是266美元。
But that cheap phone sells for $122, versus $554 for Samsung’s smash hit. 
而三星这款热卖机的售价是554美元，前面那款便宜机仅售122美元。
That is a 10 times difference in gross profit. 
二者毛利相差10倍。
Sure, commoditisation will squeeze Samsung and Apple, but it will not entirely kill their pricing power. 
当然，产品大众化会挤压三星和苹果的利润，但并不会完全使其丧失定价能力。
If consumers happily pay premiums for cigarettes and branded water, it is not hard to see value in a strong phone brand.
既然消费者会乐于为香烟和品牌饮用水支付高价，一个强大的手机品牌的价值也就不难明白。
Chinese makers could try taking on Samsung and Apple by building rival brands – but ask HTC about the risks in that. 
中国制造商可以通过建立竞争性品牌来挑战三星和苹果——但请向宏达电(HTC)请教这样做的风险。
The jump in this year’s shipments implies they are instead seeking scale in order to squeeze suppliers and grind out profits. 
今年的出货量继续大增，表明这些制造商宁愿追求规模，以便挤压供应商，榨取更多利润。
It is the better plan, but it will not make much money, either.
这是个更好的计划，但也不会让它们赚很多。
‘Tron’ is a cool, if slightly scary, name for a video-game console. 
对一款视频游戏机而言，“TRON”是个很酷（也许还有点吓人）的名字。
It is also a 1982 Disney film about being trapped in a virtual world. 
它还是一部1982年拍摄的迪斯尼电影的名字——这部电影中的主人公陷于一个虚拟世界而无法脱身。
This has not stopped Huawei from launching a gaming device by that name in China, its home market, in 2014. 
但这并没有阻止华为(Huawei)在2014年于中国国内市场推出了以这个名字命名的游戏设备。
Telecoms equipment is, however, a much larger business for this ambitious, unlisted, employee-owned company, founded by an ex-military engineer. Investors in the sector’s other big players are, increasingly, trapped in Huawei’s world.
然而，对于这家由前军队工程师创立、员工持股、雄心勃勃的未上市公司来说，电信设备是一项规模大得多的业务，电信行业中其他大公司的投资者们，正越来越多地陷入了这个由华为主导的世界。
Cheap consoles will help build Huawei’s brand now that it is shaking up consumer electronics in emerging markets, led by increasing sales of cheap smartphones. 
在廉价智能手机销量不断增长的带动下，华为正在撼动新兴市场的消费电子产品市场，在这种背景下推出廉价游戏机将有助于华为的品牌建设。
Revealing its 2013 results on Tuesday, the company said it planned to shift 80m units this year – 30m more than last year. 
华为上周曾表示，今年智能手机的目标出货量为8000万台——比去年实际出货量增长3000万台。
Selling kit to carrier networks still accounted for three-quarters or so of its $40bn in revenues last year, growing decently from 2012 levels.
华为周三宣布全年业绩时称，2013年销售收入达约400亿美元，比上年有强劲增长，同时其运营商网络业务超过75%的收入来自全球排名前50的电信运营商。
That should spook investors in Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent or Ericsson – for two reasons. 
这应该让思科(Cisco)、阿尔卡特-朗讯(Alcatel-Lucent)或爱立信(Ericsson)的投资者感到害怕，原因有二。
First, whatever it was that battered Cisco’s business in several emerging markets towards the end of 2013, it did no harm to Huawei. 
首先，临近2013年底，几个新兴市场中，所有冲击到思科业务的因素都没有影响到华为。
Potential Cisco customers might be put off by the revelations about US spies snooping via private hardware and be less worried than western politicians about China peeking down Huawei’s wires. 
美国间谍机构通过私人设备从事窃听活动被曝光之后，潜在顾客可能对思科心存疑虑，而这些顾客对中国通过华为产品开展窥探行为却没有西方政客那样担心。
But it is more likely that Huawei is simply beating the western companies in emerging markets, just as big opportunities there (the transition to 4G) come up for grabs.
不过，更大的可能是，随着新兴市场巨大商机（即向4G平台转移）的出现，华为将在新兴市场完败西方企业。
Huawei’s target for dollar revenue growth is 10 per cent per year to 2017. 
华为为营收设定的目标是，到2017年前每年增长10%。
Ericsson sees the equipment market growing at 3 per cent to 5 per cent. 
爱立信认为电信设备市场的增长率在3%到5%之间。
This suggests Huawei will take more share. 
这意味着华为将在该市场中争取更大份额。
But Huawei does not detail which divisions will provide the growth. Nor does it say much about where its capital has, or will, come from. 
不过华为并未详细说明将靠哪些部门实现这一增长，也没有透露太多有关其目前或将来资金来源的信息。
Information about employees’ share ownership or future bond issues (it sold $150m in debt in Hong Kong three years ago) is scant. 
而有关员工持股或未来发债的问题（该公司三年前曾在香港发行1.5亿美元的债券），该公司也说得很少。
It is hard to know, therefore, whether Huawei’s expansion is sustainable or not.
因此，很难判断华为的扩张能不能维持下去。
In the race to build in-car information systems, Google may be destined for the checkered flag for one simple reason: It has the killer map.
在开发车载信息系统的角逐中，谷歌公司(Google Inc.)可能会成为赢家，原因很简单：谷歌拥有地图这个杀手锏。
At the International CES show last week, Google and several car makers, including General Motors, launched the Open Automotive Alliance. 
在上周举行的国际消费电子展上，谷歌和通用汽车等汽车企业宣布成立开放汽车联盟。
This is a plan to establish Google's Android operating system as a common platform for apps in the connected car.
计划把谷歌的安卓操作系统打造成联网汽车的应用公共平台。 
That opens a new front in Google's battle with Apple, which announced plans last year to integrate its devices into car makers' dashboard control panels, and Microsoft, which developed in-car voice-activated and touch-screen technologies with Ford Motor.
至此，谷歌与苹果公司(Apple)和微软(Microsoft)之间的竞争进入了一个新的领域。苹果去年宣布计划将其产品集成到汽车仪表盘内，而微软也与福特汽车(Ford Motor)合作开发车载语音控制和触屏技术。
Given rivals' earlier moves, Google could be seen as having a late start. 
与竞争对手早已行动相比，谷歌可能起步较晚。
But the open nature of Android has obvious appeal. 
不过，安卓系统的开放性具有明显的吸引力。
The ability for a company to customize Android persuades even Google's rivals to use it; Amazon.com, for example, tweaked the software for its own Kindle reading device. 
由于企业可以对安卓系统自定义处理，这一点甚至让谷歌的竞争对手也使用该系统；比如亚马逊(Amazon.com)，该公司就在其Kindle阅读器中推出了自己的定制版安卓系统。
Given vehicle development's long lead times, these are important considerations.
鉴于汽车的开发周期很长，这方面是一个企业需要考虑的重要因素。
More important may be Google's map expertise. 
更为重要的或许是谷歌在地图方面的经验。
Having sent cars with cameras all over the world to develop its Street View capabilities, the company has created maps that are extremely accurate and up to date where others aren't. 
谷歌在全球各地派出取景车提供街景(Street View)服务，其地图的精确度和更新速度为其他竞争对手难以企及。
Think of the apology Apple had to issue in 2012 following criticism of a new version of its own Maps app, which was designed to replace Google's.
在这一方面，不难联想到苹果2012年为自己的地图应用向用户道歉一事，当时该公司尝试推出自己的新版地图应用以替代谷歌地图，但并没有获得用户认可。
The popularity of Google's maps for devices running Android and Apple's iOS creates a network effect. 
谷歌地图在搭载安卓和苹果iOS操作系统的设备上的受欢迎程度产生了网络效应。
The more people who use Google Maps, the more information Google has on factors such as traffic, and the more appealing the product becomes. 
使用谷歌地图的人越多，谷歌获取的交通等信息就越丰富，其地图服务的吸引力就越大。
Such was the logic behind Google's purchase of Waze, a real-time traffic-information app, last year.
这也是谷歌去年收购实时交通信息应用Waze的思路所在。
And don't forget a big reason for Google's interest in cartography is its autonomous vehicle program. 
此外，谷歌之所以对地图服务感兴趣，一个不容忽视的重要原因是其自动驾驶汽车项目。
A crash means something quite different for a car compared with a smartphone. 
系统崩溃对汽车的意义与智能手机完全不同。
To minimize the potential for error, a must from both a regulatory and product-liability standpoint, a self-driving car needs a painstakingly accurate map.
就自动驾驶汽车而言，无论从监管角度还是产品可靠性角度来看，要想把可能出现的错误降到最小程度，精确的地图不可或缺。
With a gaggle of companies demonstrating autonomous and semiautonomous vehicle technology at CES, and likely at this week's auto show in Detroit, the day when commercially available self-driving cars cruise U.S. roads looks less a futurist daydream and more a rapidly approaching reality. 
许多公司都在此次消费电子展上展示了全自动和半自动汽车驾驶技术，而这也可能成为本周底特律汽车展上的一大热点，由此看来，美国公路上出现商用自动驾驶汽车似乎已不再是不切实际的空想，而越来越成为指日可待的现实。
'With U.S. drivers driving 75 billion hours a year, autonomous cars are also poised to have a much greater impact on society as a whole than most people give them credit for,' Morgan Stanley said in a recent report.
摩根士丹利在最近的报告中表示，美国人一年驾驶汽车的时间为750亿小时，自动驾驶汽车对整个社会产生的影响要比多数人预期的大得多。
Google's autonomous-car program is a big reason the concept is being taken so seriously within the automotive industry. 
谷个的自动驾驶汽车项目也是汽车业如此重视这一概念的重要原因。
It isn't hard to envision the company licensing the technology for car makers just as right now it provides its Android operating system to smartphone manufacturers.
不难想像，未来会有一天谷歌向汽车企业提供自动驾驶技术的授权许可，就像现在其向智能手机制造商提供安卓系统授权许可一样。 
At the least, car companies may want to tap Google's map technology for their programs. 
至少，汽车企业可能希望在自己的程序中使用谷歌地图技术。
But Google's wider product offering means they may see it as being in their best interest to build a closer relationship with it over the long term.
不过，鉴于谷歌的产品种类较广，汽车企业与谷歌建立更紧密的长期合作关系可能符合这些厂商的最大利益。 
All of which gives Google an advantage over the likes of Apple as the autonomous age arrives and Detroit and drivers venture into unfamiliar territory without a map. 
综上所述，随着汽车自动驾驶时代来临、汽车企业和驾驶员尝试这一陌生领域，谷歌相比苹果等公司具有更大优势。
A new legal tool for U.S. investors who are locked in disputes with Chinese companies is being put to wider use.
与中资公司存在纠纷的美国投资者有了一个新的法律工具，目前这个工具的使用范围正在扩大。
A Delaware Chancery Court judge on Jan. 6 awarded investors who had tried unsuccessfully to gain access to the books of China's Yinlips Technology Inc. the ability to sell their shares back to the company.
特拉华州衡平法院一位法官于1月6日授予中国英利普科技（深圳）有限公司的投资者一项权利，使他们能够将所持股票回售给该公司，此前这些投资者尝试获得该公司财务报表信息的努力未获成功。
It also appointed a receiver to seize the company's assets to fulfill the transaction.
这家法院还聘请一位接管人来接管该公司资产，以完成这些交易。
Yinlips, an electronics company, didn't respond to a request for comment.
电子公司英利普科技未回复记者寻求置评的请求。
The ruling builds on a similar case last year, when another judge in Delaware Chancery Court granted essentially the same remedy to investors of a different Chinese company.
去年也有一起类似案件，当时特拉华州衡平法院的另一位法官授予了另一家中资公司的投资者类似的权利。
Together, the two cases are providing investors with a way to strike back at Chinese companies that cost investors money when their stocks drop because of alleged accounting or disclosure problems. 
这两起案子为类似的美国投资者提供了一个反击的方式，他们此前因为这些中资公司的股票受会计和披露等问题下跌而蒙受损失。
David Graff, a lawyer at the New York law firm of Anderson Kill who represents the investors in both cases, said he was aware of at least six other pending court cases against Chinese companies in which such a remedy could come into play.
纽约律师事务所Anderson Kill的律师格拉夫是这两起案件中投资者的代理律师，他说，他认为至少还有六起针对中资公司的诉讼案会采用这种方式。
Yinlips entered the U.S. in 2008 via a private placement of stock to investors, and Mr. Graff alleged in an interview that it 'absconded with the investor funds.' 
英利普科技于2008年通过面向投资者的私人配售进入美国市场，格拉夫在一次采访中说，这家公司骗走了投资者的资金。
Yinlips said in U.S. government filings that it planned to trade on U.S. markets. 
英利普科技此前在提交美国政府的文件中说，计划在美国市场上市交易。
But the Securities and Exchange Commission revoked the U.S. registration of the company's securities last July after Yinlips failed to file required annual and quarterly reports.
去年7月份美国证券交易委员会将该公司股票从注册名单中除名，因为此前该公司未能按要求提交年度和季度报表。
Four investors who bought a total of 1.5 million Yinlips shares in the private placement sued to force the company to open its books to them. 
在私人配售中购买了英利普科技总计150万股股票的四位投资者此前对该公司提起诉讼，以期迫使该公司向他们公开财务报表。
Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Donald F. Parsons Jr. ruled in their favor last October.
特拉华州衡平法院副大法官帕森斯在去年10月份做出了支持这些投资者的裁决。
Mr. Graff said in a court hearing last week that Yinlips ignored the ruling and that at one point the company 'forcibly removed' the investors' representatives from its offices when they informed it of the litigation.
格拉夫在上周一次庭审中说，英利普科技无视法院裁决，并且曾在这些投资者的代表前来通知诉讼信息时将他们“强行赶出”其办公室。
The judge found Yinlips in contempt, calling its conduct egregious and saying it had 'acted in bad faith.'
法官帕森斯判定英利普科技藐视法庭，称其行为极端恶劣，并且不守信用。
He awarded the investors a put option to force Yinlips to buy back their shares at fair-market value, which will be determined at a court hearing to be held in late February or early March.
他授予投资者一项出售选择权，强制英利普科技按公平市值购回这些投资者手中的股票，将于2月末或3月初举行的一次庭审将确定这一公平市值。
Mr. Parsons also appointed a receiver to help satisfy the judgment, with the authority 'to seize, deal in or dispose of any property of the company' in the U.S., China or elsewhere, according to the ruling.
据裁决文件显示，帕森斯还聘请一位接管人协助执行这一裁决，给予其接管、买卖或者处置该公司在美国、中国或者其他地区任何资产的权利。 
In his ruling, Mr. Parsons cited the earlier case, in which a different judge ruled last March that investor Peter Deutsch was entitled to force network-equipment maker ZST Digital Networks Inc. to buy back his ZST shares for above-market prices totaling more than $32 million and to have the receiver seize and sell ZST assets to satisfy the judgment.
帕森斯在裁决书中引用了此前一起案例，去年3月份另一位法官给予投资者多伊奇强制网络设备制造商神阳科技有限公司以高于市价的价格（总额超过3,200万美元）购回他所持股票的权利，并聘请了一位接管人通过接管和出售神阳科技资产来执行这一裁决。 
ZST didn't respond to a request for comment.
神阳科技未回复记者寻求置评的请求。 
It can be challenging to go after a Chinese company's assets held outside the U.S., but the receiver has said he has seized ZST bank accounts and control over some of its subsidiaries, and in August ZST indicated it was open to discussing a settlement of Mr. Deutsch's claims.
接管中资公司在美国以外地区的资产颇具挑战，但这位接管人已表示，他已经冻结了神阳科技的银行账户并且控制了其部分子公司。去年8月份，神阳科技表示，愿意就多伊奇的指控通过协商达成和解。
Mr. Graff declined to comment on the status of any ZST settlement discussions.
格拉夫拒绝就神阳科技的和解协商情况置评。
